 "interpretation": "The \"fishing pole\" card represents the act of seeking and trying to catch something, whether it be a physical fish or a metaphorical goal. This card can signify the need for patience and persistence in pursuing one's desires, as well as the importance of preparation and strategy. It may also suggest the need to let go of something that is no longer serving us, just as a fisherman must release a catch that is too small or not the right species. The \"fishing pole\" card encourages us to stay focused on our goals and take action to bring them into fruition."
