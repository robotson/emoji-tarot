 "interpretation": "The Reverse Button card represents the need to step back and reassess a situation. This card signals a time of undoing and retracing your steps to find a new path forward. It may be tempting to push forward with a plan or decision, but this card advises caution and reflection before moving ahead. \n\nThe Reverse Button can also indicate a need to retreat from a situation or relationship that is no longer serving you. Sometimes, the best course of action is to take a step back and regroup before proceeding. \n\nOverall, the Reverse Button card reminds us that it is okay to change our minds and make adjustments to our plans. It is better to backtrack and correct our course than to continue down a path that leads to a dead end. Trust your instincts and don't be afraid to hit the reverse button when necessary."
