Like a bowl of warm spaghetti, this card suggests that you should savor the moment and enjoy the fruits of your labor. It can also indicate a need to let go of any guilt or shame associated with indulging in life's pleasures. Instead, embrace the richness of your experiences and allow yourself to fully enjoy them."
