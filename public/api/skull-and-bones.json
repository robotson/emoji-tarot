 "interpretation": "The \"skull and crossbones\" emoji is a symbol of danger, warning of potential harm or even death. It can represent a warning to avoid a particular situation or person, or to take extra precautions to stay safe. It can also symbolize the end of something, such as the death of a relationship or a project. In some contexts, it may be used to convey a sense of rebellion or a rejection of societal norms. \n\nWhen this card appears in a reading, it may indicate a need to be extra vigilant or to take steps to protect oneself. It may also suggest the need to let go of something that is no longer serving you, or to embrace a more nonconformist attitude. However, it's important to remember that the \"skull and crossbones\" is a warning, not a prediction of doom - with awareness and caution, you can navigate any challenges that come your way."
