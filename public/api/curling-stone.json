 "interpretation": "The curling stone emoji represents careful planning and strategy. Just like the precision required to slide the stone along the ice, this card suggests the need for patience and attention to detail in your current situation. It may also indicate the need for teamwork and collaboration to achieve your goals. \n\nIf you draw this card, consider how you can approach your current situation with a clear plan and a focus on the small details. Take your time and don't rush into anything. It may also be helpful to enlist the help of others and work together towards a common goal. Trust in your ability to carefully navigate the situation and make calculated decisions."
