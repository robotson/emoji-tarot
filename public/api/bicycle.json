 "interpretation": "The bicycle emoji represents movement and progress. This card suggests that you are on a journey, whether physical or metaphorical, and that you are making steady progress towards your destination. Like riding a bike, you may encounter obstacles or challenges along the way, but with determination and focus, you can overcome them. This card also encourages you to enjoy the journey itself, rather than solely focusing on the end goal. Take time to appreciate the scenery and enjoy the ride. The bicycle card can also indicate a need for independence and self-reliance, as well as a desire for freedom and adventure. Embrace your inner explorer and trust in your ability to navigate any path that comes your way. "
