 "interpretation": "The \"no bicycles\" emoji depicts a red circle with a bicycle in the center and a diagonal line through it. This card is a warning that restrictions or limitations are in place and that you must heed them. It may indicate that you need to slow down and proceed with caution, avoiding risky behavior that could lead to negative consequences.\n\nThis card is also a reminder to respect boundaries, whether they are physical, emotional, or social. Sometimes it's necessary to stay within the lines and not take unnecessary risks, even if it means sacrificing a little bit of freedom. In some cases, this card may indicate that you need to take a break from a particular activity or situation for your own safety or well-being."
