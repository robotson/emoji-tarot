    "interpretation": "The Ascension Island flag emoji represents a place of isolation and exploration. This card suggests a time of solitude and introspection, where you may feel cut off from others and left to your own devices. However, this is also an opportunity for self-discovery and renewal. Take this time to reflect on your values and priorities, and consider new paths and directions that you may not have considered before. This card encourages you to be open to change and to embrace the unknown, as it may lead to unexpected growth and transformation. Like the island itself, you may feel like a small speck in a vast ocean, but remember that even the smallest actions can have a big impact. Trust in yourself and your abilities, and be willing to take risks and explore new territories. This card reminds us that sometimes the greatest discoveries can be found in the most unlikely places."
