 "interpretation": "The ðŸª§ emoji, also known as the \"placard,\" is a symbol of protest and advocacy. It represents the power of using one's voice and taking a stand for what they believe in. This card may indicate a need to speak out against injustice or to take action towards a cause that is important to you. It can also suggest a time of change or upheaval, where old systems or beliefs are being challenged and new ones are emerging. \n\nIn a reading, the ðŸª§ card may encourage you to take a more active role in a situation, to use your voice and speak up for what you believe in. It may also suggest a need to challenge the status quo and question the norms around you. Remember that the power of the ðŸª§ placard lies in its ability to bring people together and create change, so don't be afraid to rally others to your cause and work towards a greater good."
