It can indicate a need for practicality and preparedness, as well as a desire for style and self-expression. This card reminds you to trust your instincts when it comes to what you need to bring with you, whether it's a literal handbag or a metaphorical one. It can also suggest the need to let go of excess baggage, both in terms of material possessions and emotional baggage that may be weighing you down."
