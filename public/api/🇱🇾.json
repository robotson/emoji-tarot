    "interpretation": "The flag of Libya is rich with symbolism that speaks to the country's tumultuous history. The red, black, and green stripes represent the three regions of the country, while the crescent and star in the center symbolize Islam. This card represents unity and the power of revolution, as Libya underwent a revolution in 2011 that led to the overthrow of its longtime dictator. It also speaks to the concept of freedom, as the Libyan people fought for their right to self-determination. \n\nIf this card appears in a reading, it may indicate a time of upheaval and change. The querent may be experiencing a personal revolution or seeking greater freedom in their life. They may also be called to unite with others around a common cause or to fight for justice and equality. The flag of Libya reminds us that even in the face of great adversity, we have the power to come together and create a better future."
