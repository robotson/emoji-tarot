 "interpretation": "The woman detective emoji represents a search for truth and the pursuit of justice. This card suggests that you may need to investigate a situation or problem in your life to uncover hidden truths or motives. You have a keen eye for details and are able to see through deceptions and lies. Trust your instincts and don't be afraid to ask questions or dig deeper. You may need to be patient and persistent in your search, but the truth will eventually be revealed. This card can also represent a need for independence and self-sufficiency, as the detective relies on her own skills and intuition to solve cases. Keep your wits about you and stay focused on your goals."
