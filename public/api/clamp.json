 "interpretation": "The Clamp card is all about restriction and limitation. It suggests that you may be feeling trapped or held back in some way, either by external circumstances or by your own self-imposed limitations. This card can also indicate a need for discipline and structure in order to achieve your goals. The Clamp reminds us that sometimes we need to hold ourselves back in order to move forward, and that limitations can actually be a source of strength and focus. Be mindful of where you are allowing yourself to be restricted, and consider whether those limitations are serving you or holding you back. By embracing discipline and structure, you can gain greater control over your life and achieve your desired outcomes."
