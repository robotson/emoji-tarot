The scorpion is a symbol of transformation, as it sheds its skin to reveal a new and stronger self. It also represents the darker aspects of life, such as jealousy, revenge, and deceit. The scorpion encourages us to confront our fears and to embrace our shadow self, for it is only through facing our darkness that we can find true inner strength and resilience. In a reading, the scorpion may indicate a situation that requires caution and careful navigation, or it may suggest a need to tap into our own hidden potential.
