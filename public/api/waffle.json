 "interpretation": "The \"waffle\" card represents the need for structure and order in one's life. Just as a waffle is made up of organized and evenly spaced squares, this card urges the seeker to create a stable foundation for themselves. It may be time to prioritize responsibilities and create a routine to bring balance to daily life. This card also suggests the importance of taking time to nourish oneself, both physically and emotionally. It's a reminder to enjoy the sweet moments in life, but to also maintain a level of discipline. The waffle may also represent the idea of duality, as it can be both crispy and soft, sweet and savory. This card encourages the seeker to embrace and accept the various aspects of themselves and find harmony within. Some associated keywords include structure, routine, balance, discipline, nourishment, duality, and harmony."
