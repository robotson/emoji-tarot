    "interpretation": "The flag of Heard & McDonald Islands is a symbol of the remoteness and unique beauty of these uninhabited islands. This card represents isolation and detachment, a time when you may feel removed from the world around you. However, this can also be a time of introspection and self-discovery, where you can connect with your inner thoughts and feelings. Just as the islands are preserved in their natural state, this card encourages you to protect and preserve what is valuable to you. The flag also features a distinctive design, reminding you to embrace your own unique identity and stand out from the crowd. This card suggests that you may be facing a challenge or decision that requires you to think outside the box and approach things in a new and unconventional way. Trust your instincts and stay true to yourself, even if it means going against the norm."
