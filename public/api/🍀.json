    "interpretation": "The four leaf clover is a symbol of luck and good fortune. It represents the idea that sometimes we stumble upon unexpected opportunities that can change our lives for the better. This card suggests that you may be on the cusp of a lucky break, but it\u2019s up to you to seize the moment. Trust your instincts and take a chance. Whether it\u2019s a job offer, a new relationship, or a creative project, the four leaf clover indicates that success is within reach if you\u2019re willing to put in the effort. However, it\u2019s important to remember that luck is not a guarantee, and you must be prepared to take responsibility for your own actions. This card also reminds us to appreciate the small things in life, as even the tiniest bit of good luck can make a big difference."
