 "interpretation": "The railway car emoji represents movement, travel, and progress. It suggests that you are on a journey or path towards a destination, both physically and metaphorically. This card can also indicate the need to make a change or take a risk in order to move forward. It may be a time to broaden your horizons and explore new opportunities. Alternatively, it could represent feeling stuck or limited in your current situation and the need to break free from routine. The railway car is a symbol of adventure and possibility."
