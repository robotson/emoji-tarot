It may indicate a feeling of being overlooked or not listened to, leading to a sense of powerlessness and resentment. \n\nThis card serves as a reminder to take a step back and reassess the situation. It may be time to speak up and express your feelings, but it's important to do so in a constructive and respectful way. Alternatively, it may be necessary to let go of expectations and accept things as they are, rather than dwelling on what could have been. \n\nAssociated keywords: frustration, dissatisfaction, resentment, powerlessness, communication, acceptance."
