 "interpretation": "The Japanese “discount” button emoji symbolizes a desire for bargains and savings. It may represent a frugal attitude towards spending, or a need to stretch resources. This card can also suggest a mindset of abundance, as one looks for opportunities to save money without compromising on quality or value. However, it may also indicate a fear of missing out on deals or a tendency to prioritize cost over other factors. In a broader sense, this card invites reflection on the role of money and material possessions in one’s life, and encourages a balanced approach to financial decisions."
