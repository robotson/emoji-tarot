 "interpretation": "The \"koala\" card represents comfort, relaxation, and a need for rest. This card reminds us to slow down, take a break, and focus on self-care. It's a sign that we may be feeling overwhelmed or overworked, and need to prioritize our own well-being. The koala also symbolizes protection, as they cling tightly to their tree branches for safety. This may indicate a need for boundaries or a desire to feel safe and secure. Alternatively, it could suggest a need to be more nurturing or protective of others. Overall, the \"koala\" card is a gentle reminder to prioritize our own needs and find comfort in our surroundings."
