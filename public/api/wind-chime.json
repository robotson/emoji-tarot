 "interpretation": "The Wind Chime card represents a sense of movement and change. Just as wind chimes create a melody through the movement of air, this card suggests that transitions and fluctuations in life can also create a beautiful harmony. It may be a time to let go of old patterns and embrace new opportunities, or to embrace the ebb and flow of life's natural rhythms. The Wind Chime card can also indicate a need for adaptability and flexibility in the face of change. "
