It\u2019s important to acknowledge your feelings and find healthy ways to express them. This could involve talking to a trusted friend or therapist, or engaging in physical activity to release pent-up energy.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling angry, take a moment to pause and reflect on what\u2019s causing this emotion. Is it something that can be addressed or resolved? If so, take action to make a change. If not, focus on accepting the situation and finding ways to cope with your feelings.\n\nOverall, the Anger Symbol card is a powerful reminder that emotions are a natural part of the human experience. It\u2019s important to acknowledge and express them in a healthy way, rather than suppressing them or allowing them to control us."
