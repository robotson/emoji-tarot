    "interpretation": "The Down Arrow card represents a period of decline, lowering, or descent. It could indicate a decrease in energy, motivation, or mood. It could also signify a decline in financial or social status. This card suggests a need to surrender to the natural flow of life and accept that sometimes things must go down before they can go up. It could also indicate a time for introspection, reflection, or letting go of what no longer serves you. Be patient, trust the process, and know that everything will eventually rise again."
