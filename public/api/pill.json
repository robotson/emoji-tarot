 "interpretation": "The \"pill\" card represents the need for healing and self-care. It can indicate a desire for quick fixes or a dependence on medication, both physically and emotionally. This card can also suggest a need to confront and address underlying issues instead of just masking symptoms. Associated keywords include healing, medication, addiction, self-care, and avoidance. It's important to remember that seeking help and taking care of oneself is not a weakness but a strength."
