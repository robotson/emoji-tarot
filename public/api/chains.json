It suggests that you are feeling trapped or limited in some way, either by external circumstances or by your own beliefs and fears. It is a reminder that you may be holding yourself back from achieving your full potential by allowing negative thoughts or patterns to control you.\n\nThis card can also indicate that you are under the control of someone or something else, such as a boss, a partner, or an addiction. You may feel like you have no choice or power in your situation, but the \"Chains\" card encourages you to look for ways to break free and assert your independence.\n\nOn a positive note, this card can also represent the discipline and structure necessary to achieve your goals. Sometimes, limitations can be a source of strength and focus, helping you to channel your energy into a specific direction.\n\nOverall, the \"Chains\" card is a reminder to examine the ways in which you are limiting yourself and to find ways to break free from negative patterns and beliefs. Only then can you fully embrace your potential and achieve your dreams."
