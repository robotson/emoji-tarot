    "interpretation": "The volcano emoji represents a sudden outburst of intense energy or emotion. It can symbolize a situation that has been simmering beneath the surface and is now ready to erupt. This could be a personal emotional eruption or a larger event that affects many people. The volcano card can also suggest the need to release pent-up feelings or to confront a long-standing issue. The eruption may be destructive, but it can also clear the way for new growth and transformation."
