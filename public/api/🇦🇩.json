    "interpretation": "The Andorran flag emoji represents the small, landlocked country nestled in the Pyrenees mountains between Spain and France. As such, it embodies the idea of sovereignty and independence. This card suggests a time of personal pride and the need to stand tall in one's beliefs and values. It encourages a sense of unity and cooperation with others to achieve common goals. The flag of Andorra also features a motto, \"virtus unita fortior,\" or \"virtue united is stronger,\" which underscores the importance of strength through unity. This card may indicate a need to collaborate with others to achieve a greater good. It also reminds us that our differences can be a source of strength rather than division. In short, the Andorran flag emoji represents a time of personal sovereignty and the need to work together for the common good."
