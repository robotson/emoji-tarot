    "interpretation": "The NG button emoji represents rejection, disapproval, and negativity. It is a reminder to take heed of the things that are not working out in your life and to reject them. This card can signify a need to let go of negative patterns, people, or situations that are holding you back. It is time to say \"no\" to things that do not serve your best interests and to embrace a more positive outlook.\n\nThis card may also indicate that you are facing criticism or disapproval from others. It is important to remember that you cannot please everyone and that sometimes, rejection is necessary for growth. Use this as an opportunity to reassess your goals and make adjustments as needed.\n\nIn a relationship reading, the NG button emoji may suggest that there is a lack of compatibility or a need to set boundaries. It could be time to end a relationship or to have an honest conversation about what is not working.\n\nOverall, the NG button emoji reminds us that sometimes, saying \"no\" is the best thing we can do for ourselves. Trust your instincts and do what is right for you."
