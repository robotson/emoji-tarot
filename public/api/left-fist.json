 "interpretation": "The left-facing fist emoji symbolizes power and strength. It represents the ability to take action and stand up for oneself or for a cause. This card can indicate a need to be assertive and take control of a situation. It can also suggest a time of conflict or confrontation, where one must defend their beliefs or values. However, it is important to use this power wisely and not let it become destructive. Instead, harness the energy of the left-facing fist to make positive changes and overcome obstacles."
