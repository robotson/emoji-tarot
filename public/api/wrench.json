 "interpretation": "The Wrench card represents the need to fix or adjust something in your life. This could be a physical object that requires repair or maintenance, or it could be a situation that needs your attention and adjustment. The Wrench also reminds you to take responsibility for your own life and make necessary changes to improve your situation. This card encourages you to be proactive and take action to solve problems rather than simply waiting for them to resolve themselves. It can also symbolize the need for flexibility and adaptability in the face of unexpected challenges. Remember that sometimes a small adjustment can make a big difference. The Wrench card invites you to step into your power and take control of your life."
