 "interpretation": "The speech balloon emoji represents communication, dialogue, and conversation. It can indicate a need to express oneself or to listen to others. It may also suggest the need for clarity or the potential for misunderstandings. This card encourages you to speak your truth and to actively listen to those around you. It may also signify the importance of clear communication in relationships and the power of words to connect or divide. Pay attention to the tone and intention behind your words and be open to different perspectives. This card reminds you that communication is a two-way street and that active listening is just as important as speaking. Embrace the power of conversation and use it to build understanding, foster connections, and express yourself authentically."
