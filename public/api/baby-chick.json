 "interpretation": "The Baby Chick card represents new beginnings, innocence, and vulnerability. Like a newly hatched chick, you may feel unsteady or unsure of your place in the world. However, just as the chick quickly adapts to its surroundings, you too will find your footing and grow stronger. Embrace your fresh start and allow yourself to learn and grow. Be open to new experiences and opportunities. Remember to stay true to your authentic self, as this is the key to success and happiness. This card also reminds us of the importance of nurturing and protecting those who are vulnerable or in need of our care. Take care of yourself and those around you with kindness and compassion."
