 "interpretation": "The Unlocked card represents a sense of freedom and access to something that was previously inaccessible. This can manifest in many ways, such as finally achieving a long-sought goal or breaking free from a situation that has been holding you back. The Unlocked card can also indicate a release from a mental or emotional blockage that has been hindering your progress.\n\nThis card reminds you that the key to unlocking your potential lies within yourself, and that with determination and effort, you can overcome any obstacle. However, it is important to remember that with freedom comes responsibility, and you must be mindful of the consequences of your actions.\n\nIn a reading, the Unlocked card can indicate a positive change or breakthrough, but it can also suggest that you need to let go of old habits or beliefs that are holding you back. Embrace the freedom that this card represents and take the opportunity to explore new possibilities and experiences."
