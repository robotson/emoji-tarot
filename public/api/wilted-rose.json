 "interpretation": "The wilted flower emoji represents the end of a cycle, the fading of beauty, or the passing of time. This card may indicate a loss or disappointment, as well as the need to let go of something that is no longer serving you. It is a reminder that all things must come to an end, and that new beginnings can only emerge from the ashes of what has passed. The wilted flower also symbolizes resilience, as even in its fading state, it still holds a certain amount of beauty and potential. This card can be a call to reflect on what has withered in your life and to find the courage to release it."
