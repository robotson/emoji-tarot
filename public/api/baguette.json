Just as bread is a staple food, this card suggests that you have a strong foundation upon which to build. This card may also indicate abundance and plenty, as bread has historically been a symbol of wealth and prosperity. Trust that you have everything you need to succeed, and remember to share your bounty with those around you. This card may also suggest the importance of simplicity and the pleasures of the simple things in life. Take time to enjoy the small pleasures, and remember that sometimes the most basic things can be the most satisfying. "
