 "interpretation": "The White Question Mark card represents a state of uncertainty and confusion. It indicates that the situation or the question at hand is unclear and requires more information before proceeding. This card can also signify a lack of direction or purpose, where one may feel lost or unsure of what to do next. It suggests that it is time to pause, reflect and seek clarity before making any decisions. Alternatively, it may indicate that the answer lies within and one needs to trust their intuition to guide them. This card reminds us to stay curious and open-minded, to embrace the unknown and to seek answers through exploration and discovery."
