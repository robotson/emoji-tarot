 "interpretation": "The \"sweat droplets\" emoji can signify a range of emotions and situations, from nervousness and anxiety to physical exertion and hard work. This card reminds us that sometimes we have to push ourselves beyond our limits to achieve our goals. It also serves as a warning to not let stress and pressure overwhelm us, as too much of either can lead to burnout and exhaustion. In relationships, this card can indicate a need for open communication and honesty, as sweating the small stuff can lead to bigger problems down the line. "
