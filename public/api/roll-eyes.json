 "interpretation": "The face with rolling eyes emoji suggests a sense of annoyance, disbelief, or disapproval. This card represents a situation where you feel frustrated or exasperated, perhaps with someone or something that is not living up to your expectations. It may also indicate that you are being dismissive or condescending towards someone or a situation. However, it is important to check your attitude and see if you are being too judgmental or unfair. Instead of rolling your eyes, try to communicate your concerns in a constructive manner.

Overall, the face with rolling eyes emoji reminds us to be mindful of our reactions and to approach conflicts with patience and understanding."
