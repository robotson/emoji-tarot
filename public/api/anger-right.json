 "interpretation": "The \"right anger bubble\" card depicts an intense and focused burst of anger. This anger is not just any anger, but a righteous one, fueled by a sense of injustice or wrongdoing. The anger is not directed at just anyone, but at a specific target who deserves to be called out. The card suggests that it is important to speak up and assert oneself in situations where one's values or beliefs are being challenged or violated. However, it is also important to channel this anger in a constructive way, rather than lashing out blindly. The card reminds us that anger can be a powerful force for change, but it needs to be tempered with reason and compassion.\n\nIf this card appears in a spread, it may indicate that the querent is feeling angry or frustrated about a situation that they perceive as unfair or unjust. The card suggests that the querent has a right to be angry, but should also consider how to channel this anger in a constructive way. They may need to speak up or take action to address the issue, but should do so with a clear head and a sense of purpose. The card may also suggest that the querent needs to stand up for themselves or for someone else who is being wronged."
