 "interpretation": "The \"divide\" card is represented by the ➗ emoji, which depicts a simple division sign. This card signifies a separation or a division in one's life, whether it be a physical or emotional separation from a person or situation, or a need to divide one's attention or resources. It could also represent a decision that needs to be made, where one must choose between two options. This card suggests that this separation or decision may be difficult or painful, but ultimately necessary for growth and progress. The \"divide\" card reminds us that sometimes we must let go of things that no longer serve us, in order to make room for new opportunities and experiences."
