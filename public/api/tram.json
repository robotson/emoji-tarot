 "interpretation": "The tram emoji represents a journey, whether it be physical or metaphorical. This mode of transportation can indicate movement towards a destination, and the need to stay on track in order to reach a goal. However, it can also signify a lack of control or being at the mercy of external forces. It is important to be aware of your surroundings and adapt to changes as they arise. This card reminds us to be patient and enjoy the ride, even if it may be bumpy at times."
