 "interpretation": "The \"label\" card represents the need for identification and categorization. It suggests a desire for organization and a clear understanding of where things belong. This card may indicate a need to put a name or tag on something in order to make it easier to manage or understand. It can also suggest the need for personal identification or clarification of one's own identity. The \"label\" card reminds us that everything has a place and a purpose, and that sometimes it's necessary to put things in their proper category in order to move forward. However, it can also be a warning against over-categorization or labeling, which can lead to narrow-mindedness or prejudice. Overall, the \"label\" card encourages us to find a balance between categorization and openness, and to embrace the power of identification and organization in our lives."
