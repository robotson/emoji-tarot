 "interpretation": "The Coffin emoji represents endings, closure, and transformation. It can indicate the need to let go of something that is no longer serving us, whether that be a relationship, a job, or an old way of thinking. This may be a difficult process, but it is necessary in order to move on and make room for new beginnings. The Coffin can also symbolize the end of a chapter in our lives and the beginning of a new one. It can be a reminder that death is a natural part of life, and that it is important to appreciate the time we have. The Coffin may also represent a need for rest and rejuvenation, as we take time to reflect on our past experiences and prepare for what is to come."
