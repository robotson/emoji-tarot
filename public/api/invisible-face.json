 "interpretation": "The dotted line face emoji represents uncertainty and confusion. This card suggests that you may be feeling unsure about a situation or decision in your life, and that it's important to take the time to carefully consider all options before making a move. The dotted line face can also indicate a need for clarity and focus, as you may be feeling scattered or distracted. It's important to trust your intuition and stay grounded in the present moment, rather than getting caught up in worries about the future or regrets about the past. Remember that uncertainty is a natural part of life, and that it can often lead to growth and new opportunities. Stay open-minded and adaptable, and be willing to embrace the unknown."
