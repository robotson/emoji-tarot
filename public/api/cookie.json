 "interpretation": "The Cookie card is a symbol of indulgence and comfort. It represents the need for a little sweetness in life, and the desire for immediate gratification. The cookie encourages us to take a moment to enjoy life's small pleasures and to savor the present moment. However, it also reminds us to be careful not to overindulge, as too much of a good thing can lead to negative consequences. The cookie card encourages us to find balance between indulgence and restraint. It may also be a sign that we need to take a break and treat ourselves to something enjoyable."
