 "interpretation": "The \"water pistol\" card represents a sense of playfulness and mischief. It can indicate a desire to let loose and have fun, possibly at the expense of others. However, it's important to remember that this card is not necessarily negative, as it can also suggest a need to shake things up and inject some levity into a situation. At its core, the \"water pistol\" card encourages a lighthearted approach to life, and reminds us not to take ourselves too seriously."
