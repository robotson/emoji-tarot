 "interpretation": "The \"metro\" card represents a journey, both physically and metaphorically. This card signifies movement, progress, and the need to go places. It is a symbol of adventure, exploration, and the unknown. The metro can be a crowded and overwhelming space, so it may also represent feeling lost or unsure of where to go next. However, it is important to trust the journey and have faith in the destination. This card may also signify a need for structure and routine in order to achieve goals. The metro can be a means of transportation to reach a specific destination, but it can also represent the journey of life and the experiences that shape us along the way."
