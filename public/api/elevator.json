 "interpretation": "The \"elevator\" card represents a time of transition and movement. Just as an elevator takes you up or down, this card indicates a change in your current situation. This change may be physical, such as moving to a new location, or it could be metaphorical, such as a change in your beliefs or values. Whatever the change may be, this card indicates that it is a necessary step in your journey. \n\nIn a reading, the \"elevator\" card may suggest that you need to let go of the past and embrace this new phase in your life. It may also indicate that you need to take a risk and step outside of your comfort zone in order to reach your goals. Trust that this change is leading you to a better place, and be open to new opportunities that come your way. Remember, just like an elevator, you have the power to choose which direction you want to go."
