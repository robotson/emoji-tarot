 "interpretation": "The \"ogre\" card represents a force of darkness and chaos that threatens to disrupt your life. This emoji depicts a fearsome, red-faced creature with horns, fangs, and a menacing expression. It is a warning that you may encounter someone or something that seeks to intimidate, harm, or manipulate you. This could be a bully, a predator, a rival, or a temptation that tests your willpower. The ogre also symbolizes the shadow side of your own psyche, the part of you that is driven by anger, greed, or lust, and that needs to be acknowledged and integrated. To deal with this card, you need to summon your inner strength, courage, and wisdom, and to resist the urge to run away or fight back blindly. You may need to seek help from allies, mentors, or spiritual guides who can provide you with guidance and protection. The ogre can also be a source of transformation and growth, if you learn to face it with compassion, insight, and humility. By confronting your fears and shadows, you can discover hidden talents, resources, and truths that can empower you. "
