 "interpretation": "The \"pause button\" represents a moment of stillness and reflection. It suggests that it's time to take a break from the hustle and bustle of daily life and take a moment to pause and consider your next steps. This card can also indicate a need for balance and moderation in your actions. It's a reminder that sometimes it's okay to slow down and take a breather, rather than constantly pushing forward. The \"pause button\" can also represent a period of waiting or delay, encouraging you to be patient and trust that things will unfold in their own time."
