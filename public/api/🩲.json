This could be in the form of physical protection, such as wearing a helmet or carrying pepper spray, or emotional protection, such as setting boundaries or seeking therapy. The briefs card can also indicate a need for privacy and personal space. You may feel vulnerable or exposed in certain situations, and this card encourages you to prioritize your own needs and well-being. Overall, the briefs card reminds you to take care of yourself and to seek out the support and protection you need to feel safe and secure."
