This card may also indicate a need for organization and structure in your life, as the symbols on this card represent the building blocks of code and programming.\n\nOverall, the Input Symbols card reminds us to be intentional in our communication and to use technology as a means of connection rather than a source of isolation. Embrace the language of technology, but don't forget the importance of human connection and understanding."
