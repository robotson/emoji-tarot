This card indicates that there are certain areas in your life where you are not allowed to go or things that you are not allowed to do. It may be frustrating or discouraging, but sometimes it's necessary for your own safety and protection. This card reminds you to respect boundaries and rules, and to find alternative paths or solutions when faced with obstacles. It also suggests that you may need to set some boundaries of your own, to protect yourself from unwanted influences or situations. Use your intuition and common sense to discern what is safe and what is not, and don't be afraid to say \"no\" when necessary. Overall, the \"no entry\" card urges you to be mindful of your limitations and to honor the limitations of others."
