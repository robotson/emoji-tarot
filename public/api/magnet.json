 "interpretation": "The magnet emoji represents attraction and connection. Just like how a magnet is drawn to metal, this card suggests that you are being drawn to someone or something in your life. It could be a romantic partner, a new job opportunity, or even a hobby that you're passionate about. This card encourages you to embrace this attraction and follow where it leads you. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that a magnet also has a repelling force. This could mean that there are people or situations that you need to let go of in order to fully embrace this new attraction. Trust your intuition and let go of anything that no longer serves you. "
