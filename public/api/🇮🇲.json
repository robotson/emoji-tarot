    "interpretation": "The Isle of Man flag represents the pride and tradition of a small, independent island community. This card encourages you to embrace your unique identity and take pride in your heritage. It may also indicate a need to reconnect with your roots and traditions, or to seek out a community that shares your values and beliefs. Like the Isle of Man itself, this card suggests a sense of self-sufficiency and independence, but also a willingness to work together for the common good. Trust in your community and the power of shared values to guide you on your path."
