 "interpretation": "The Weary Face card represents a feeling of exhaustion, frustration, and overwhelm. You may be feeling burnt out from work, relationships, or life in general. Itâ€™s important to take a step back and rest, recharge, and prioritize self-care. This card may also indicate a need to delegate tasks or ask for help, as trying to do everything on your own can lead to burnout. Be mindful of your limits and make sure to set boundaries with those who may be taking advantage of your time and energy. Remember that itâ€™s okay to take a break and prioritize your well-being. This card serves as a reminder to slow down and focus on self-care to avoid becoming completely overwhelmed."
