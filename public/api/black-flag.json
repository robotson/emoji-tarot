 "interpretation": "The Black Flag card represents rebellion and defiance. It signifies a willingness to stand up against injustice, even if it means going against the norm. This card can also signify protest and a call to action, urging you to take a stand for what you believe in. However, it's important to note that this card can also represent danger, as going against the status quo can come with consequences. The Black Flag card encourages you to assess the risks and rewards before taking action, but also reminds you that sometimes taking a stand is necessary for change. This card can also symbolize a need for secrecy or discretion, as the black flag was historically used by pirates to signal danger or a desire for privacy. Overall, the Black Flag card reminds you to be bold and fearless in your actions, but to also be aware of the potential consequences."
