 "interpretation": "The \"satellite\" emoji represents a need for distance and perspective. It reminds us to step back and observe from a higher viewpoint, detached from our personal biases and emotions. This card can indicate a time of introspection, where we need to examine our beliefs and values objectively. It can also suggest a need for communication and connection, as satellites facilitate long-distance communication and broadcasting. Alternatively, this card can represent a feeling of being monitored or watched, or a fear of surveillance. Overall, the \"satellite\" card invites us to seek clarity and understanding through a broader perspective."
