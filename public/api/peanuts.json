 "interpretation": "The peanuts card represents abundance and nourishment. Just like a handful of peanuts can provide sustenance, this card reminds us that we have everything we need to thrive. It also signifies hard work paying off and reaping the rewards. However, be mindful not to hoard or become greedy with your resources. This card encourages generosity and sharing with others. Trust that there is enough to go around and that you can create a bountiful life for yourself and those around you. "
