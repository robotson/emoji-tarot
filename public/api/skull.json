 "interpretation": "The skull emoji represents the ultimate symbol of death and mortality. It signifies the end of a cycle or phase in life, and the beginning of a new one. This card may indicate that a significant change is coming, and that it may be time to let go of old habits or beliefs that no longer serve you. It may also suggest that you need to confront your fears and embrace the unknown, as death is a natural part of life and can lead to transformation and rebirth.\n\nThe skull can also represent the need for introspection and self-reflection. It may be a reminder to focus on the present moment and to live each day to the fullest, as life is fleeting. This card can be a warning against taking life for granted or being too attached to material possessions, as they will not bring true happiness in the face of death.\n\nOverall, the skull card encourages us to embrace change and to see it as an opportunity for growth and renewal. It reminds us that every ending is a new beginning, and that death is not the end, but rather a transition into something new and unknown."
