 "interpretation": "The crab emoji represents protection, self-defense, and retreat. Like the crab that retreats into its shell when threatened, this card suggests the need to create boundaries and protect oneself from harm. It can also indicate a need to take a break and withdraw from a situation to regroup and recharge. The crab is a reminder to be cautious and not rush into things without first assessing the risks. It can also signify emotional sensitivity and the need to protect oneself from being hurt by others. Overall, the crab card encourages us to prioritize our well-being and safety."
