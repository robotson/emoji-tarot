 "interpretation": "The Grimacing Face emoji depicts a tense and uncomfortable expression. It suggests feelings of awkwardness, embarrassment, or anxiety. You may be facing a situation that makes you uneasy or unsure of how to proceed. Alternatively, you may be hiding your true emotions behind a facade of forced cheerfulness. This card reminds you to acknowledge and confront your discomfort, rather than suppressing it. Only by facing your fears can you overcome them and move forward. Be honest with yourself and others, even if it means admitting vulnerability. Don't let fear hold you back from expressing your true self."
