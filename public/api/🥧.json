    "interpretation": "The Pie card represents a time of nourishment and abundance. Just like a pie that is filled to the brim with delicious ingredients, you too are overflowing with abundance and satisfaction. This card encourages you to share your abundance with those around you, whether it be physical possessions or emotional support. Remember that giving can be just as satisfying as receiving.\n\nThis card can also represent a time of indulgence and overconsumption. Be mindful of not taking too much for yourself, and be aware of the consequences of your actions. Remember that true satisfaction comes from a healthy balance of giving and receiving.\n\nThe Pie card is a reminder to be grateful for what you have and to share your blessings with others. Enjoy the abundance in your life and spread the love to those around you."
