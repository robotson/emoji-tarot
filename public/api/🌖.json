    "interpretation": "The waning gibbous moon emoji symbolizes a time of transition and change. It represents the period between the full moon and the last quarter, where the moon appears to be shrinking in size. This card may suggest that you are in the midst of a transformational phase in your life, where you are shedding old patterns and beliefs to make way for new growth.\n\nThe waning gibbous moon can also represent the need to release and let go of things that no longer serve you. It may be time to declutter your physical space, cut ties with toxic relationships, or simply release negative thoughts and emotions.\n\nThis card can also indicate a time of heightened intuition and psychic abilities. Trust your inner guidance and pay attention to your dreams and synchronicities. The waning gibbous moon encourages you to embrace your spiritual side and connect with the divine."
