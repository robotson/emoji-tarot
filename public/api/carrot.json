 "interpretation": "The \"carrot\" card represents growth and nourishment. Just as a carrot grows from a tiny seed into a nutritious root vegetable, this card signals a time of growth and development. This could refer to personal growth, such as learning a new skill or overcoming a challenge, or to external growth, such as a new job opportunity or the expansion of a project. The carrot is also associated with health and wellness, reminding us to prioritize self-care and nourishment. In a reading, this card may indicate a need to focus on personal growth and nourishment, or suggest that positive changes are on the horizon. "
