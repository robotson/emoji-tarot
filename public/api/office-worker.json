 "interpretation": "The \"Office Worker\" card represents your career and work life. This card emphasizes the importance of routine, responsibility, and a strong work ethic. You may be someone who enjoys the structure and stability of a 9-to-5 job, or perhaps you are seeking more structure and stability in your work life. This card suggests that you take your job seriously and that you are committed to your career.\n\nHowever, this card can also indicate that you may be feeling stuck or unfulfilled in your current job. It may be time to re-evaluate your career goals and consider making a change. Alternatively, this card could represent a need for more balance in your work and personal life. It may be time to step back from your work responsibilities and focus on self-care and relaxation.\n\nOverall, the \"Office Worker\" card reminds us to take pride in our work and to approach our career with a strong sense of responsibility and work ethic."
