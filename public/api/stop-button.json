It can also indicate a need to set boundaries and say \"no\" to things that are draining your energy. The \"stop button\" reminds us that taking breaks and setting limits is essential for our well-being and productivity. Associated keywords include pause, break, boundaries, evaluation, and rest. This card can also symbolize a need for closure or an end to a situation that is no longer serving you. Trust your intuition and take the time you need to rest and recharge."
