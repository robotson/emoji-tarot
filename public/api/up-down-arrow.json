It may also indicate a need to make a decision or to choose between two options, reminding you that every choice has its consequences. Remember to trust your intuition and to listen to your inner voice when making important decisions. The \"Up-Down Arrow\" card teaches you to embrace the ebb and flow of life and to find balance in all aspects of your being."
