    "interpretation": "The \"person: bald\" card represents a clean slate and a sense of starting anew. Just as hair can grow back after being shaved off, this card suggests a fresh start and a chance to reinvent oneself. It can also symbolize humility and a lack of vanity, as baldness can often be associated with letting go of superficial concerns."
