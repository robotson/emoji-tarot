 "interpretation": "The Stadium card represents a grand spectacle or event that draws large crowds. It can indicate a competitive atmosphere, with participants striving to outdo each other in a show of skill or talent. The card may also suggest a sense of performance, where individuals feel the need to put on a show or be seen in a certain light. This can be both positive and negative, as it may inspire a sense of community and shared experience, but can also lead to a focus on superficial appearances over genuine connection.\n\nThe Stadium card can also represent a desire for recognition or attention, as individuals seek to stand out in a sea of faces. This can be a time of heightened energy and excitement, but it is important to remember that true connection and meaning can often be found in quieter moments of reflection.\n\nOverall, the Stadium card speaks to the power of shared experiences and the desire for recognition and validation. It reminds us to be mindful of our motivations and to seek connection and meaning beyond the surface level."
