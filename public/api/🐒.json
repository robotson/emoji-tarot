    "interpretation": "The monkey card represents playfulness, curiosity, and a mischievous nature. Like the monkey swinging from branch to branch, you may find yourself jumping from one idea to the next or exploring different paths in life. However, be careful not to get too distracted or lose focus on your goals. The monkey also symbolizes intelligence and adaptability, reminding you to be flexible and resourceful in any situation. On the flip side, it can also indicate a tendency towards impulsiveness or being easily swayed by others. Trust your instincts, but also take time to think before you act. Overall, the monkey card encourages you to embrace your playful and adventurous side while also staying grounded and focused on your objectives."
