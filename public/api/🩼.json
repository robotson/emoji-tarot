    "interpretation": "The \"crutch\" emoji depicts a walking aid used to support someone who has difficulty walking due to an injury or disability. As a tarot card, it represents a time of reliance on external support to help you move forward. It suggests that you may be feeling vulnerable or unsure of yourself, and need to lean on others for assistance. This card can also indicate a need to take care of yourself physically and emotionally, to avoid burnout and fatigue. \n\nIn a reading, the \"crutch\" card may suggest that you need to reach out to friends or family for help, or seek professional assistance to aid in your healing process. It can also indicate a time to slow down and take care of yourself, rather than pushing through pain or discomfort. Ultimately, this card reminds us that it is okay to ask for help, and that seeking support can lead to positive growth and healing."
