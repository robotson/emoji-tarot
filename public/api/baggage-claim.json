 "interpretation": "The \"baggage claim\" emoji represents the end of a journey and the anticipation of finally reaching your destination. It can indicate a sense of relief and accomplishment after a long and tiring journey, but also a need to deal with the consequences of the past. This card reminds us to confront our emotional baggage and to let go of things that are no longer serving us. It can also suggest a need to take stock of our experiences and reflect on the lessons we've learned. The \"baggage claim\" card is a symbol of closure and resolution, but also of new beginnings and fresh starts. "
