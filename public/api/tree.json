 "interpretation": "The \"deciduous tree\" emoji represents growth, strength, and rootedness. Just as a tree sheds its leaves and grows new ones, we too must let go of old habits and beliefs in order to grow and evolve. This card reminds us to stay grounded and connected to our roots, while also reaching for the sky and embracing change. The deciduous tree also symbolizes the cyclical nature of life, reminding us that everything has its season and that change is inevitable. "
