 "interpretation": "The waning crescent moon emoji represents the end of a cycle or a phase. This card suggests that it is time to let go of things that no longer serve us and prepare for new beginnings. It is a time to reflect on past actions and evaluate what has worked and what hasn't. This card can also indicate a period of rest and rejuvenation before starting something new. \n\nOverall, the waning crescent moon card reminds us that everything in life has a cycle and it is important to embrace the endings as much as we embrace the beginnings. By letting go of what no longer serves us, we create space for new opportunities and growth."
