 "interpretation": "The seal emoji represents balance and adaptability. Like a seal navigating through different environments, you are able to adapt to any situation and find equilibrium. This card also suggests the need for flexibility in your approach to challenges. Trust your instincts and go with the flow, rather than trying to force a certain outcome. The seal reminds you to take care of your physical and emotional well-being, as balance in these areas is essential for overall harmony. This card can also indicate a need to connect with your intuition and tap into your inner wisdom. Trust yourself and your abilities to navigate through any situation that comes your way."
