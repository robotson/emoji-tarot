 "interpretation": "The \"last track button\" emoji represents the desire to revisit the past, whether it be a memory or a previous phase in life. It can indicate a need to reflect on past experiences and learn from them in order to move forward. This card can also suggest a reluctance to let go of the past and a tendency to dwell on what has already happened rather than focusing on the present or future. The \"last track button\" can serve as a reminder to let go of past mistakes and embrace new beginnings. "
