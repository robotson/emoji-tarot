 "interpretation": "The snowboarder emoji depicts someone who is adventurous, daring, and willing to take risks. This card suggests that you may be in a period of your life where you are willing to try new things and push yourself out of your comfort zone. You may be feeling a surge of energy and excitement, and are ready to take on any challenges that come your way.\n\nThe snowboarder card also represents the importance of balance and focus. Just like a snowboarder needs to maintain their balance on the slopes, you too must find a way to balance your goals and priorities. Stay focused on what you want to achieve, but don't forget to take breaks and enjoy the journey."
