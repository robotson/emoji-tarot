 "interpretation": "The \"bagel\" emoji represents cycles, unity, and wholeness. Like a bagel, life often repeats itself in a circular pattern, and the card may suggest that you are at a point in your life where you are experiencing a recurring situation. However, this cycle can also signify the unity and oneness of all things, reminding you that everything is interconnected. The bagel can also represent the idea of \"wholeness,\" meaning that you may be seeking to complete a task or achieve a goal. The card suggests that you may need to focus on bringing all the pieces together to achieve a sense of completeness. In a relationship reading, the card may suggest that both partners are equally important and that there is a need for balance and unity. Overall, the \"bagel\" card is a reminder that everything is connected, and that cycles of life are natural and necessary for growth and transformation."
