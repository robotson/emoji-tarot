  "interpretation": "The \ud83e\udebb emoji represents the \"hyacinth\" card in our tarot deck. The hyacinth is a symbol of rebirth and renewal, as it blooms in the springtime after lying dormant during the winter. This card encourages you to embrace change and to see it as an opportunity for growth and transformation. It reminds you that even when things seem bleak, there is always the potential for new beginnings.\n\nWhen the hyacinth card appears in a reading, it may indicate that a major change is on the horizon, and that you should be open to new possibilities. It may also suggest that you need to let go of old patterns or beliefs that are holding you back, and to embrace a more positive outlook on life. Trust that the universe has a plan for you, and that everything will work out in the end."
