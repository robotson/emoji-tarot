 "interpretation": "The \"antenna bars\" card represents connectivity and communication. Just like the signal strength displayed on a mobile device, this card indicates the strength of your connections with others. It suggests that you may be seeking to establish or strengthen a connection with someone, or that you need to pay more attention to maintaining the relationships you already have. This card can also indicate a need to improve your communication skills in order to better convey your thoughts and emotions. Alternatively, it may be a sign that you are feeling overwhelmed or overstimulated by the constant barrage of information and communication in your life. In this case, it may be helpful to take a break from technology and reconnect with the world around you. Associated keywords include: connectivity, communication, relationships, technology, information, overload."
