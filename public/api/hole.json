 "interpretation": "The Hole card represents the unknown and the mysterious. It symbolizes a void, an emptiness, and a depth that is waiting to be explored. This card can be both exciting and intimidating, as it represents the potential for discovery but also the fear of the unknown. The Hole card reminds us that there is always more to explore and discover, and that sometimes we need to take a leap of faith and embrace the darkness to find the light. This card can also represent the need to let go of old patterns and beliefs that no longer serve us, and to embrace the uncertainty of the future. The Hole card asks us to trust in our own ability to navigate the unknown, and to have faith that whatever lies ahead is meant to be. When this card appears in a reading, it may be a sign to embrace the mystery and the potential of the unknown, and to be open to new possibilities and experiences."
