    "interpretation": "The flag of Tokelau is a symbol of the isolation and simplicity of this small island nation. This card may represent a sense of community and belonging, but also a feeling of being cut off from the rest of the world. The message is to find comfort in the people and resources around you, and to focus on what is essential. The flag of Tokelau reminds us that sometimes, the most straightforward solutions are the best ones. Embrace the simple life, and don't worry too much about what's happening elsewhere. Instead, turn your attention to your immediate surroundings and the people who share them with you. Remember that even in isolation, we can find connection and meaning."
