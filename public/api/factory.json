 "interpretation": "The Factory card represents the world of production, industry, and labor. It is a symbol of the modern world, where human beings have harnessed the power of machines to create mass-produced goods. This card can signify the need for hard work and dedication to produce something valuable, but it can also represent the negative impact of industrialization on the environment and the exploitation of workers.\n\nThe Factory card can also suggest the influence of capitalism on our lives, where profit and efficiency are prioritized over human needs and the well-being of the planet. This card may indicate a need to re-evaluate our relationship with material possessions and the way we consume resources.\n\nOn a more personal level, the Factory card can represent the need to be productive and efficient in our own lives. It may indicate a time of hard work and dedication to a particular goal, but it is important to be mindful of the impact this may have on our own health and well-being.\n\nOverall, the Factory card asks us to consider the balance between productivity, environmental impact, and social justice in our modern world."
