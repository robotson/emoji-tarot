 "interpretation": "The Japanese “vacancy” button emoji, represented by a square with the character “空” in the center, signifies emptiness or absence. This card can indicate a feeling of detachment, a need for space, or a lack of fulfillment in a situation. It may also suggest the need to let go of something or someone that is no longer serving a purpose. While the “vacancy” button may seem negative, it can also represent potential for new possibilities and growth. Embrace this emptiness as an opportunity for reflection and transformation."
