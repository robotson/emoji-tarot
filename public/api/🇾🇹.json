    "interpretation": "The Mayotte flag emoji represents a small island located in the Indian Ocean that is a French territory. This card is a symbol of unity and harmony. It reminds us to come together with those around us and work towards a common goal. The island setting of Mayotte represents the importance of finding balance in our lives, and not becoming too isolated from the world around us. The French influence on Mayotte reminds us to embrace the diversity of cultures around us, and to learn from those who are different from ourselves. When this card appears in a reading, it is a sign that it is time to focus on working together with others to achieve our goals. We must remember that we are all part of a larger community, and that it is only by working together that we can achieve true success and happiness."
