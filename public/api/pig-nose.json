 "interpretation": "The \"pig nose\" card symbolizes a strong connection to the earthly realm and a reminder to focus on the present moment. The pig's nose is associated with rooting around in the dirt, seeking out sustenance and pleasure. This card reminds us to indulge in the simple pleasures of life and to not take ourselves too seriously. It is a sign of abundance and prosperity, but also a warning against greed and gluttony. The pig nose also suggests a need for relaxation and self-care, urging us to take time to pamper ourselves and enjoy the little things in life. Overall, this card encourages us to embrace our physical bodies and senses, and to be fully present in our surroundings."
