This card can indicate a need for practical skills or a reminder to take a more methodical approach to a problem. It can also suggest the need to mend or repair something that has been neglected or damaged. Alternatively, this card can symbolize the act of creating something new, whether it be a physical object or a new idea. The sewing needle reminds us that progress often requires small, incremental steps and that even the most complex projects can be broken down into manageable pieces."
