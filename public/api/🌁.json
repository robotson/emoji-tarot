    "interpretation": "The Foggy card represents a sense of confusion and uncertainty, much like a fog that obscures our view and makes it difficult to see the path ahead. This card can indicate a period of concealment or a lack of clarity in a situation, where things are not as they seem. It is important to take a step back and reassess the situation, rather than making impulsive decisions. Trust your intuition and wait for the fog to clear before taking action. This card can also indicate a need for introspection and reflection, as the foggy conditions allow us to explore our own emotions and thoughts without external distractions. It is a reminder to take your time, be patient, and trust the journey, even if the destination is unclear."
