 "interpretation": "The Anger Symbol card represents intense feelings of frustration and rage. This emotion can be triggered by situations that make you feel powerless or out of control. You may feel like youâ€™re at the mercy of external forces, and this can cause you to lash out in anger.\n\nThis card is a reminder to take a deep breath and try to regain control of your emotions. Itâ€™s important to acknowledge your feelings and find healthy ways to express them. This could involve talking to a trusted friend or therapist, or engaging in physical activity to release pent-up energy.\n\nIf youâ€™re feeling angry, take a moment to pause and reflect on whatâ€™s causing this emotion. Is it something that can be addressed or resolved? If so, take action to make a change. If not, focus on accepting the situation and finding ways to cope with your feelings.\n\nOverall, the Anger Symbol card is a powerful reminder that emotions are a natural part of the human experience. Itâ€™s important to acknowledge and express them in a healthy way, rather than suppressing them or allowing them to control us."
