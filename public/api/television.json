 "interpretation": "The \"television\" card represents the need for distraction and escape. It suggests a desire to tune out from reality and immerse oneself in entertainment. This could be a sign of avoiding difficult emotions or situations. It can also indicate a craving for connection, as TV can be a way to bond with others over shared interests. However, this card also warns against overindulgence and mindless consumption. It reminds us to be mindful of what we are watching and how it affects our mood and perspective. Overall, the \"television\" card encourages balance and intentionality in our media consumption."
