 "interpretation": "The full moon represents a time of culmination and heightened emotions. It illuminates the darkness and brings clarity to situations. This card can indicate a time of completion, fulfillment, or the peak of a cycle. However, it can also signify intense feelings and the need to release pent-up emotions. Trust your intuition and allow yourself to be guided by your inner wisdom."
