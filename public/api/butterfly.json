 "interpretation": "The butterfly emoji represents transformation, change, and growth. It is a symbol of beauty and grace, and reminds us to embrace the journey of life. Just as the butterfly goes through a metamorphosis, shedding its old form to emerge as a new, vibrant creature, we too must shed our old selves and embrace new beginnings. This card encourages you to embrace change and transformation, and to trust in the process of growth. It reminds you that change can be beautiful and that you are capable of transformation. The butterfly also symbolizes joy and freedom, and encourages you to let go of any fears or doubts that may be holding you back. Trust in your own wings and take flight towards your dreams."
