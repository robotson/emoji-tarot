 "interpretation": "The jack-o-lantern emoji represents transformation and illumination. Just as a pumpkin is carved and transformed into a spooky face, we too can transform ourselves and shed our old ways to reveal a new, brighter self. The light emanating from the jack-o-lantern is a symbol of guidance and enlightenment, reminding us to follow our inner wisdom and intuition. This card also represents the Halloween season, a time for celebrating the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. "
