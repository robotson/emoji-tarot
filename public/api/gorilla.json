 "interpretation": "The gorilla emoji represents strength, power, and dominance. It is a symbol of being in control and taking charge of situations. This card can indicate a need to assert yourself and stand up for what you believe in. However, it can also suggest a need for caution and not letting your power go to your head. The gorilla reminds us to use our strength wisely and not to abuse it."
