 "interpretation": "The frog emoji represents transformation and adaptation. Just like how a tadpole transforms into a frog, this card signifies a period of growth and change. It suggests that you may need to let go of old habits and embrace new ones in order to progress in your journey. The frog also symbolizes the ability to adapt to different situations, reminding you to be flexible and open-minded in your approach to challenges. Keep in mind that change can be uncomfortable, but it can also bring new opportunities for growth. Trust that you have the strength and resilience to navigate through any changes that come your way.
