    "interpretation": "The parrot emoji represents communication and sociability. Just like the colorful bird it depicts, this card suggests that you may be drawing attention to yourself and standing out in a positive way. You may be feeling chatty and outgoing, or perhaps you are attracting people to you with your wit and charm. Alternatively, the parrot can also indicate that you need to be careful with your words, as they may be misinterpreted or taken out of context. Remember to listen to others as well as speak your mind. This card can also suggest a desire for travel or exploration, as the parrot is known for its ability to mimic different sounds and languages. Overall, the parrot encourages you to embrace your unique voice and connect with others through open and honest communication."
