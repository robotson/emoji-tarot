    "interpretation": "The \"manual wheelchair\" card represents movement and independence. It symbolizes the ability to overcome obstacles and challenges through determination and perseverance. This card can also indicate a need for assistance or support from others. The manual wheelchair reminds us that there is strength in vulnerability and that asking for help is not a sign of weakness. It can also suggest a need for adaptability and flexibility in situations where our usual methods of moving forward may not be available. Overall, the manual wheelchair card encourages us to keep moving forward despite any limitations or setbacks we may face, and to seek out the support and resources we need to do so. "
