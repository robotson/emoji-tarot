    "interpretation": "The \"zombie\" emoji represents a state of mindlessness and lack of purpose. This card may indicate a period of feeling stuck or directionless, as if you're just going through the motions without any real motivation or passion. It may also suggest a need to break free from old habits or ways of thinking that no longer serve you. However, there is a potential for renewal and transformation, as the zombie can also symbolize the process of shedding old skin and emerging as a new, revitalized version of yourself. Trust in your ability to rise from the ashes and create a new path for yourself."
