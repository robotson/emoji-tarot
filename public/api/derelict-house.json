 "interpretation": "The derelict house emoji represents abandonment, neglect, and decay. It is a symbol of a once-thriving structure that has been left to deteriorate. This card may indicate a situation where something that was once important or valuable has been forgotten or neglected. It can also suggest a need to let go of old, outdated ideas or beliefs that are holding you back. The derelict house can be a warning to address issues before they become irreparable."
