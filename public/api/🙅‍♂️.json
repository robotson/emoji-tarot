    "interpretation": "The \"man gesturing NO\" card represents a strong sense of refusal and rejection. This card indicates a need to assert boundaries and say \"no\" to something or someone in your life. It may be necessary to turn down an opportunity or set limits in a relationship. This refusal can be difficult, but it is important to prioritize your own needs and values. Trust your instincts and stand firm in your decision."
