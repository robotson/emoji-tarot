 "interpretation": "The 🗂️ emoji, also known as \"card index dividers,\" suggests organization and categorization. This card can indicate a need to sort through information or ideas to find what is relevant or important. It can also suggest a need to compartmentalize different aspects of one's life or to create structure in a chaotic situation. On the flip side, this card may indicate a tendency to become overly rigid or inflexible in one's thinking or approach. "
