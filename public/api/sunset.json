 "interpretation": "The sunset emoji represents the ending of a cycle or phase in your life. It's a time for reflection, letting go, and moving on. Just as the sun sets, so too must this chapter come to a close. Take time to reflect on what you've accomplished, what you've learned, and what you want to bring with you into the future.\n\nThe sunset card can also indicate completion, a sense of closure or finality. It's a reminder that everything has its time and place, and that sometimes we must say goodbye in order to make room for new beginnings.\n\nAssociated keywords include reflection, endings, completion, transition, and nostalgia. When this card appears in a reading, it's a sign that you're ready to move on from the past and embrace the future with open arms. Trust that everything will work out as it's meant to, and that the universe has a plan for you."
