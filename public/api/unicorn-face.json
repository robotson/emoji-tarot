This card can also represent a sense of wonder and awe, and a desire to explore new realms of possibility. When the unicorn appears in a reading, it may suggest that we need to reconnect with our inner child, or to seek out sources of inspiration and joy in our lives.

Overall, the unicorn is a powerful symbol of hope, wonder, and possibility, and encourages us to embrace the magic in our lives."
