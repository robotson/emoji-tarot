 "interpretation": "The \"downcast face with sweat\" emoji represents feelings of stress, anxiety, and discomfort. This card may indicate a sense of overwhelm or the need to take a step back and regroup. The sweat droplets on the face suggest that there may be a physical response to these emotions, such as sweating or a racing heart. \n\nThis card may appear when there is a need to address and confront difficult emotions, rather than pushing them aside. It may also suggest the need for self-care and taking time to rest and recharge."
