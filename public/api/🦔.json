    "interpretation": "The hedgehog emoji represents protection and defense. Just like a hedgehog's quills, this card warns of potential danger and the need to stay alert. It may also indicate the need to establish boundaries and protect oneself from negative energy or harmful situations. On the flip side, the hedgehog can also signify the need to let down your guard and trust others. Its cute and cuddly appearance reminds us that sometimes it's okay to be vulnerable and open up to others. Overall, the hedgehog card encourages us to find a balance between protection and vulnerability."
