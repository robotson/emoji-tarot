    "interpretation": "Gemini is the card of duality and communication. Representing the third sign of the zodiac, Gemini is known for its ability to adapt and change quickly. People born under this sign are known for their versatility and flexibility, often juggling multiple projects or interests at once. The twin symbols represent the dual nature of Gemini, showing both the light and dark sides of this sign.\n\nIn a tarot reading, the Gemini card may indicate a need for adaptability and communication. It can also suggest a time of change and transformation, where it is important to be flexible and open-minded. This card may also suggest the need to balance different aspects of your life, or to embrace your own dual nature."
