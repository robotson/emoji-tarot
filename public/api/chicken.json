 "interpretation": "The chicken emoji represents a sense of caution or hesitancy. Just like a chicken pecking around the yard, this card suggests that you may be hesitant to take action or make a decision. It may be wise to take a step back and assess the situation before moving forward. On the other hand, the chicken can also represent fertility and new beginnings. This may be a time to start fresh and hatch new plans. Trust your instincts and take small steps towards your goals."
