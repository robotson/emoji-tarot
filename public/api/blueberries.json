It reminds us that we deserve to be nourished and fulfilled, and that we have the power to create abundance in our lives.\n\nThis card can also represent the idea of growth and expansion. Blueberries grow on bushes that can reach impressive heights, and this emoji may symbolize our own potential for growth and achievement. It encourages us to reach for the stars and not be afraid to dream big.\n\nAssociated keywords: abundance, nourishment, self-care, growth, expansion, potential, fulfillment, achievement, superfood."
