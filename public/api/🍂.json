    "interpretation": "The fallen leaf emoji represents endings, transitions, and the inevitability of change. Just as leaves must fall from trees, so too must we let go of old patterns and habits to make way for new growth and opportunities. This card may indicate a time of release, a necessary shedding of the old to make room for the new. It may also suggest a need to embrace impermanence, to let go of attachments and find beauty in the fleeting moments of life.\n\nIn a reading, the fallen leaf may suggest the need to move on from a situation or relationship, to let go of something that is no longer serving you. It may also indicate a time of transformation, a period of growth and renewal after a difficult period. Trust in the process of life and embrace the changes that come your way, knowing that each ending brings with it the seeds of new beginnings."
