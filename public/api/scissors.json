 "interpretation": "The Scissors card represents the act of cutting, whether it be physical or metaphorical. This card is a reminder that sometimes we must make difficult choices in order to move forward. The Scissors card also suggests a separation or division, either within ourselves or with others. It may indicate the need to cut ties with someone or something that no longer serves us. \n\nIn a positive context, the Scissors card can represent a breakthrough or the successful completion of a project. However, it can also indicate a painful ending or the need to let go of something that we have been holding onto for too long. \n\nOverall, the Scissors card encourages us to make decisive and intentional choices, even if they are difficult. By cutting away what no longer serves us, we can create space for growth and new opportunities."
