 "interpretation": "The \"ear of corn\" emoji represents abundance and fertility. Just like how a single corn kernel can grow into a whole cob, this card suggests that the querent's hard work and efforts will yield great results. It may also indicate a time of plenty, whether it be material or emotional. However, it's important to remember that abundance can also lead to excess and waste, so be mindful of not taking more than what is necessary."
