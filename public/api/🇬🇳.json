    "interpretation": "The flag of Guinea represents the country's independence and freedom, which were achieved on October 2, 1958. The flag features three vertical stripes of red, yellow, and green, with a yellow star in the middle. The red stripe represents the blood of those who fought for independence, the yellow stripe represents the sun and the country's mineral wealth, and the green stripe represents the country's vegetation and agricultural resources. The yellow star in the middle represents the unity of the country's people.\n\nIn a tarot reading, the flag of Guinea represents a desire for independence and freedom. It can indicate a need to break free from oppressive situations or people and to assert oneself. It also suggests the importance of unity and working together towards a common goal. This card encourages one to embrace their unique identity and to stand up for what they believe in."
