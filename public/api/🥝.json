    "interpretation": "The Kiwi Fruit card represents a new beginning and fresh opportunities. Just as the kiwi fruit has a tough exterior but a sweet and flavorful interior, this card reminds us to not judge things solely based on their appearance. It also symbolizes growth and progress, encouraging us to take risks and try new things. The kiwi fruit is a reminder that sometimes the most rewarding experiences come from stepping outside of our comfort zones. Trust your instincts and embrace the unknown, as it may lead to unexpected and positive outcomes."
