 "interpretation": "The \"face with crossed-out eyes\" emoji represents confusion, disorientation, and being overwhelmed. It can indicate a feeling of being lost or out of control, as if everything is spinning out of reach. This card may suggest that you need to take a step back and reassess your situation, as you may be feeling too overwhelmed to see clearly. \n\nThe crossed-out eyes also symbolize a lack of vision or understanding, and may indicate that you are struggling to see the bigger picture. However, this card can also represent a temporary state of confusion that will pass with time, and may indicate that you need to trust the process and have faith that things will become clear in due course. \n\nOverall, the \"face with crossed-out eyes\" card reminds us that sometimes we need to take a break and rest our minds, rather than pushing ourselves to the point of exhaustion. It encourages us to trust our instincts and intuition, and to seek clarity and understanding when we feel lost or overwhelmed."
