 "interpretation": "The \"woman walking\" card represents movement and progress. It suggests a journey, either physically or metaphorically, and the need to keep moving forward. This card can indicate a time of transition, where one is leaving the past behind and moving towards a new phase in life. It can also suggest independence and self-sufficiency, as the woman is walking alone. The card encourages taking action and not being afraid to take the first step towards your goals. "
