 "interpretation": "The astronaut emoji represents exploration, adventure, and the pursuit of the unknown. This card encourages you to step out of your comfort zone and embrace new experiences. Whether it's a physical journey or a personal challenge, the astronaut reminds you that you have the courage and determination to succeed. The astronaut also symbolizes a sense of detachment, suggesting that you may need to distance yourself from a situation in order to gain perspective. Use your intuition and trust in your abilities to navigate uncharted territory and achieve your goals. "
