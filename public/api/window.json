 "interpretation": "The \"window\" card represents a view into new opportunities, perspectives, and potential growth. Like a window, it offers a glimpse into what lies beyond our current situation. This card encourages us to broaden our horizons and consider new possibilities. It reminds us that sometimes we need to step outside of our comfort zone to achieve our goals. \n\nReversed, this card may indicate a fear of the unknown or a resistance to change. It could also suggest a tendency to become too focused on one narrow perspective, hindering our ability to see the bigger picture. It is important to remember that windows can also be closed, and sometimes we need to let go of old ideas and beliefs to embrace new opportunities."
