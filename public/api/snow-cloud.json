 "interpretation": "The üå®Ô∏è \"cloud with snow\" card represents a time of cold and stillness, where everything is covered in a blanket of snow. This is a time for introspection and reflection, as the quietness of the snow invites us to turn inward and connect with our inner selves. The snow also represents purity and clarity, reminding us to let go of any negative emotions or thoughts and embrace a fresh start. \n\nThis card can indicate a time of challenges and obstacles, but also a time of new beginnings and opportunities. It can also represent the need to slow down and take a break, to recharge and regain our energy. \n\nAssociated keywords: winter, stillness, introspection, reflection, purity, clarity, challenges, obstacles, new beginnings, opportunities, rest, recharge."
