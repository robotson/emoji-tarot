 "interpretation": "The whale emoji represents a sense of vastness, depth, and power. It is a reminder of the magnitude of our emotions and the mysteries that lie within us. As a card, it may signify a time of introspection and a need to dive deep into our subconscious. The whale is also associated with communication and community, reminding us of the importance of connecting with others and finding our tribe. It can be a symbol of protection and guidance, as whales are known to be gentle giants who help other creatures in need. However, the whale can also represent a sense of overwhelm or feeling swallowed up by our emotions or circumstances. As with the ocean, the whale can be both awe-inspiring and daunting, but it is ultimately a reminder of the beauty and power of nature and our own inner world."
