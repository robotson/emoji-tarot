    "interpretation": "The \"prince\" emoji depicts a young man wearing a crown, representing authority, power, and leadership. As a tarot card, it suggests a time of expansion and growth, where the seeker may be taking on new responsibilities or stepping into a position of authority. It also suggests a need for confidence and assertiveness in decision-making. \n\nThe \"prince\" card can represent a person in the seeker's life who embodies these qualities, or it may symbolize the seeker themselves embodying these traits. It encourages the seeker to take charge of their situation and make decisions with conviction. "
