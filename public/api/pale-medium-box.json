 "interpretation": "The White Medium Square is a card of beginnings and possibilities. It represents a blank slate, a fresh start, and a chance to create something new. This card invites you to let go of past experiences and beliefs, and approach situations with an open mind. It represents a state of neutrality, where there is no judgment or preconceived notions. This neutrality allows you to see things clearly and make decisions that are not influenced by emotions or biases.\n\nThe White Medium Square is a symbol of potential and the infinite possibilities that exist in every situation. It represents a time to reflect and consider all options before taking action. This card reminds you that you have the power to create your own reality and to shape your future. It encourages you to embrace your creativity and imagination and to explore new avenues of self-expression.\n\nIn a reading, the White Medium Square may indicate a need to step back and reassess a situation before taking action. It may suggest a time of reflection or a period of transition. This card may also represent a new opportunity or a fresh start in a particular area of your life."
