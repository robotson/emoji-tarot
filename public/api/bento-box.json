 "interpretation": "The Bento Box card represents balance and variety. It is a symbol of harmony between different elements, both in your external and internal worlds. Like a well-arranged bento box, your life should have a mix of different experiences, relationships, and emotions. This card reminds you to strive for diversity and adaptability, rather than sticking to the same routine or mindset. \n\nAt the same time, the Bento Box card also reminds you to find balance and order within this variety. You cannot just throw random things together and expect them to work well. Instead, you need to organize and prioritize your different aspects of life, and find a way to make them complement each other. \n\nWhen the Bento Box card appears in a reading, it may indicate a need for more variety or harmony in your life. Or, it may suggest that you have already achieved this balance, and you should continue to maintain it. This card can also represent creativity, resourcefulness, and the ability to make the most of what you have. "
