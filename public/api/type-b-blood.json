 "interpretation": "The B button emoji represents the idea of choice and individuality. Just as blood types are unique to each person, so are our personalities and decisions. This card encourages you to embrace your individuality and make choices that align with your values and beliefs. Trust in yourself and your instincts, even if they go against the norm. The B button reminds us that our differences are what make us special and valuable.\n\nThis card may also represent the concept of balance, as the B button is often paired with the A button on gaming consoles. Consider how you can find balance in your life and make choices that promote harmony and peace.\n\nIn a reading, the B button may indicate a need to make a decision or a choice that is true to your individuality. It may also suggest a time of self-discovery and exploration. Embrace your unique qualities and don't be afraid to stand out from the crowd."
