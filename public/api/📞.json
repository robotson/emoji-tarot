This card may indicate a need to reach out to someone or to have a conversation that will bring clarity or resolution to a situation. It can also suggest the importance of listening and being receptive to what others have to say. On the flip side, this card may warn against over-reliance on technology for communication and the need to make genuine, personal connections. "
