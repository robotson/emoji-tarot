    "interpretation": "The fog emoji represents confusion, uncertainty, and lack of clarity. It symbolizes a state of mind where things are not clear, and you are unable to see the way forward. Just like the mist that can obscure your vision, this card suggests that you are having trouble seeing the bigger picture or understanding the situation fully.\n\nThe fog emoji reminds you to take a step back and gain some perspective. It is essential to see things in a more objective manner and not get carried away by emotions or biases. The card also suggests that you may need to slow down and take things one step at a time. Rushing into things without a clear understanding of the situation can be detrimental.\n\nIn a reading, the fog emoji can indicate a time of confusion, ambiguity, or a lack of direction. It can also represent a need for introspection, reflection, and a deeper understanding of yourself. The card reminds you to trust your intuition and not be afraid to seek guidance from others."
