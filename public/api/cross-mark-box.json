 "interpretation": "The \"cross mark button\" is a symbol of closure, indicating the end of a cycle or a decision to cut ties. This card suggests that it is time to let go of something that no longer serves you. It may be a relationship, a job, a belief system, or a habit. Embrace the power of saying \"no\" and creating healthy boundaries. Trust that the universe has something better in store for you. This card can also indicate a need for caution or a warning to avoid a potential danger. Stay alert and trust your instincts. Don't be afraid to hit the \"delete\" button on toxic people or situations. It's time to move forward and make space for new opportunities."
