 "interpretation": "The Up-Left Arrow card represents a change of direction. Just like the arrow, your path may be changing and leading you in a new direction. This card can signify progress and movement in a new direction. It may also indicate a need for you to change your current course of action. Sometimes we need to take a step back before we can move forward. Trust in the journey and know that the universe is guiding you towards your highest good. This card is a reminder to stay open to new possibilities and be willing to take a chance. When this card appears, it's time to embrace the unknown and move forward with confidence."
