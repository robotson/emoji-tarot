 "interpretation": "The snake emoji represents transformation and change. Snakes shed their skin and emerge renewed, just as we can shed old patterns and beliefs to grow and evolve. However, this card also reminds us to be cautious of deceit and hidden agendas, as snakes are often associated with trickery and danger. It encourages us to trust our intuition and stay alert to potential threats. The snake can also symbolize sexuality and sensuality, inviting us to explore our desires and passions. Overall, this card encourages us to embrace change and growth, while remaining mindful of potential pitfalls."
