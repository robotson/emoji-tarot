 "interpretation": "The goat emoji represents ambition, independence, and a strong-willed nature. Goats are known for their tenacity and determination, and this card suggests that you have the power to achieve your goals through hard work and perseverance. However, be careful not to become too focused on your own success, as the goat can also represent a tendency towards selfishness and a lack of empathy for others. Embrace your inner goat and harness its energy to push yourself towards success, but remember to remain humble and compassionate along the way. "
