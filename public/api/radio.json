 "interpretation": "The \"radio\" card represents the power of communication and the transmission of information. It signifies a need to listen to others and to be open to new ideas. This card is a reminder that we all have a voice and that our words have the ability to influence and inspire others. It can also indicate the need to tune in to our own intuition and inner voice. The radio card encourages us to be curious and to seek out new knowledge and experiences. It reminds us that communication is a two-way street and that listening is just as important as speaking."
