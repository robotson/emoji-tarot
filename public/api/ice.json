 "interpretation": "The \"ice\" card represents a sense of detachment and emotional distance. It suggests a need to remain cool and unemotional in the face of challenges or conflicts. The ice can symbolize the need for clarity and a clear head when making decisions, as well as the potential for isolation and loneliness. The card may also suggest a need to embrace the power of stillness and contemplation, and to find peace in the midst of chaos. When this card appears, it may be a reminder to remain calm and composed, to focus on rationality rather than emotion, and to find the beauty in stillness and solitude."
