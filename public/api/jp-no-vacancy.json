 "interpretation": "The Japanese “no vacancy” button emoji symbolizes a closed or unavailable situation. This card may indicate that a particular opportunity or path is not currently accessible. It may be necessary to look for alternative options or wait for a better time to pursue this goal. This card can also represent a need for boundaries or a reminder to respect the boundaries of others. Be mindful of situations where you may be trying to force your way into a closed-off space. Trust that the universe has a plan for you and that everything happens in its own time."
