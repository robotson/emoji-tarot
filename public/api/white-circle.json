 "interpretation": "The White Circle card represents completion and wholeness. It signifies that a journey has come to an end, and you have achieved what you set out to do. It is a symbol of unity, reminding you that everything in life is connected, and that you are part of a larger whole. The White Circle is also a reminder of infinity, suggesting that there is no end to what you can achieve. \n\nAt the same time, the White Circle can represent emptiness, reminding you that sometimes it is necessary to let go of the past and move forward with a clean slate. It is a time to release old patterns and beliefs that are no longer serving you, so that you can create space for new experiences and opportunities. \n\nWhen the White Circle appears in a reading, it is a sign that you have reached a point of completion or closure in a particular area of your life. It is time to celebrate your achievements and embrace the sense of wholeness that comes with it. You may also be called to let go of old patterns or beliefs that are no longer serving you, and create space for new possibilities."
