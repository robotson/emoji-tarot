 "interpretation": "The Candle emoji represents light, warmth, and guidance. It suggests that in times of darkness, there is always hope and a way forward. The flame of the candle symbolizes the spark of inspiration, and the illumination of knowledge. This card can indicate a need for meditation, reflection, or contemplation, as well as a call to action, to seek the truth, or to spread light in the world. The candle can also represent a spiritual or religious practice, or a connection to the divine. It can signify a ritual, a celebration, or a commemoration. Reversed, the Candle may indicate a lack of direction, confusion, or a need to let go of old beliefs or habits that no longer serve us. The Candle invites us to light the way for ourselves and others, to be a beacon of hope and positivity, and to keep the flame of our passions burning bright."
