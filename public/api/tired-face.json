 "interpretation": "The \"tired face\" emoji depicts a person with a frown and closed eyes, suggesting exhaustion, frustration, and stress. This card may represent a period of burnout, where you feel like you are running on empty and struggling to keep up with the demands of life. It is a reminder to take a break, recharge, and prioritize self-care. \n\nThe \"tired face\" card may also indicate a sense of hopelessness or defeat, where you feel like giving up or that your efforts are futile. However, it is important to remember that rest and rejuvenation can lead to renewed energy and a fresh perspective. "
