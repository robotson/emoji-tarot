 "interpretation": "The \"disguised face\" emoji represents hiding one's true identity or intentions. This card can indicate a need to be cautious of those around you, as someone may not be who they seem. Alternatively, it could suggest that you yourself are not being honest with others and may need to come clean. This card can also represent playing a role or putting on a facade in order to fit in or achieve a goal. It is important to consider the consequences of deception and whether it is worth sacrificing authenticity. The \"disguised face\" card reminds us to be aware of the masks we wear and the ones others wear around us."
