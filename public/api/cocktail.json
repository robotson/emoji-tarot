 "interpretation": "The \"cocktail glass\" emoji represents indulgence, celebration, and socializing. It is a symbol of enjoying life and letting loose. This card may indicate a need for relaxation and unwinding, or it may suggest a time of fun and festivities. However, it can also indicate overindulgence and recklessness if not balanced with moderation. This card encourages you to take a break from your routine and enjoy the pleasures of life. It reminds you to appreciate the good things and to share them with others. Be mindful of excess and remember to drink responsibly."
