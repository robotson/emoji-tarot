 "interpretation": "The tiger face emoji represents power, strength, and courage. It is a symbol of primal instincts and the raw energy of the natural world. This card suggests that you have the potential to tap into your inner strength and overcome any obstacles in your path. It may also indicate a need to be bold and assertive in your actions, taking risks and pushing boundaries to achieve your goals. However, be careful not to let your fierce nature turn into aggression or arrogance. Remember to balance your strength with grace and compassion. In relationships, this card may indicate a passionate and intense connection, but also a need for mutual respect and understanding. Trust your instincts and embrace your wild side, but stay grounded and mindful of the impact of your actions on others."
