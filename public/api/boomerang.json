 "interpretation": "The boomerang emoji is a symbol of return and repetition. Just as a boomerang flies through the air and returns to its starting point, this card indicates that something from your past may resurface or a situation may cycle back around. This can be an opportunity to revisit a past mistake and correct it or to reclaim something that was lost. However, be mindful that this card can also represent a negative cycle that needs to be broken. Take a step back and evaluate whether you are caught in a harmful pattern and need to make changes to break the cycle. Overall, the boomerang card reminds us that everything we put out into the world has a way of coming back to us, for better or for worse."
