    "interpretation": "The oyster emoji symbolizes hidden treasures and secrets. Like an oyster that protects a pearl within its shell, this card suggests that there may be something valuable that is hidden from view. This may be a personal talent or trait that you have not yet fully discovered, or it could be a secret that has been kept from you. The oyster card encourages you to be patient and persistent in your search for these hidden gems. \n\nOn the flip side, the oyster can also represent the need to protect oneself and set boundaries. Just as an oyster shell protects the pearl, you may need to put up walls to safeguard your own interests or well-being. This card reminds you that it's okay to say \"no\" and to prioritize your own needs."
