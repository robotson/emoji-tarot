    "interpretation": "The \"ghost\" card represents a spiritual presence or haunting from the past. This can manifest as a feeling of being watched or a sense of unease in a particular location. It can also symbolize unresolved emotions or unfinished business that need to be addressed in order to move forward. The ghost can be a reminder to confront our fears and confront the things that are holding us back. It is important to acknowledge and honor the past, but also to let go of what no longer serves us.
