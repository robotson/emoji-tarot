    "interpretation": "The \"package\" card represents the arrival of something new, whether it be a physical object or a metaphorical gift. This can be a surprise that brings excitement or a long-awaited delivery that brings relief. The package may also symbolize the potential of what is inside, the mystery of the unknown. However, it's important to remember that not all packages are positive - they could contain unwanted surprises or burdens. The \"package\" card reminds us to be open to new opportunities and to approach them with curiosity and caution."
