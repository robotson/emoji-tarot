It also signifies the power of nature and the ocean, and the importance of respecting and appreciating the natural world around us.\n\nWhen this card appears in a reading, it may indicate a need to go with the flow, to let go of control and surrender to the journey. It may also suggest a time of transition or transformation, where old patterns and habits are being washed away to make room for new growth and possibilities. Trust in the process, and allow yourself to be carried by the waves of life."
