 "interpretation": "The Hamster card represents a period of rest and relaxation. Just like how hamsters take their time to enjoy their little homes, this card is a reminder to slow down and take a break from the hustle and bustle of life. It can also indicate a need to be more independent and self-sufficient, as hamsters are known for being able to fend for themselves. Additionally, this card can signify the need to be more cautious and aware of potential dangers, as hamsters are small and vulnerable creatures."
