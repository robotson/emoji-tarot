 "interpretation": "The \"Hot Face\" card represents a powerful surge of emotion or energy that can feel overwhelming. This card may indicate a situation where passions are running high, or where you are feeling intense pressure to succeed. You may feel like you're in the middle of a raging fire, struggling to keep up with the heat.\n\nAt the same time, the \"Hot Face\" card can also indicate the potential for transformation and growth. Just as a fire can be destructive, it can also be a catalyst for change and renewal. If you can harness the energy of this card, you may be able to achieve great things, but be careful not to let your emotions get the best of you.\n\nThis card may also be a warning to avoid burnout. If you are feeling overwhelmed or overworked, it may be time to take a step back and reassess your priorities. Remember that self-care is just as important as hard work, and that sometimes the best way to move forward is to take a break and let yourself cool off.\n\nOverall, the \"Hot Face\" card is a powerful symbol of intensity and passion. Whether you're feeling the heat of success or the pressure of a difficult situation, this card reminds you to stay focused and to use your energy wisely."
