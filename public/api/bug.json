 "interpretation": "The bug emoji represents transformation and growth. Just as a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly, this card is a reminder that change is inevitable and can lead to beautiful outcomes. It can also suggest the need for patience, as transformation takes time. This card may also indicate a need to shed old habits or beliefs in order to grow and evolve. On the flip side, the bug can also represent feeling small or insignificant, or being overlooked by others. However, it's important to remember that even the smallest creatures have a purpose and contribute to the larger ecosystem."
