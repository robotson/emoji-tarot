    "interpretation": "The men's room emoji symbolizes a need for privacy and a desire for personal space. It suggests a time for introspection, reflection, and perhaps a need to detach from the hustle and bustle of daily life. This card may indicate a time of solitude, where one can reflect on their inner thoughts and emotions. It may also suggest the need to seek out a private space to recharge and regroup."
