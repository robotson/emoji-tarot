 "interpretation": "The Cyclone card represents chaos and upheaval. It indicates a period of intense change that may feel overwhelming and difficult to navigate. This card suggests that you may be experiencing a tumultuous time in your life, but it is important to remember that this too shall pass. Just as a cyclone eventually dissipates, so too will the challenges you are facing. \n\nHowever, it is crucial to stay grounded and centered during this time. Take care of yourself and seek support from those around you. Trust that you have the strength to weather the storm and come out stronger on the other side. \n\nKeywords: Change, turbulence, upheaval, chaos, transformation, adaptation, power, unpredictability, intensity."
