 "interpretation": "The zebra emoji represents duality and balance. Just as the zebra has black and white stripes, this card symbolizes the need to find harmony between opposing forces in your life. It can indicate a need to find balance between work and play, or between your head and your heart. The zebra encourages you to embrace your unique qualities and to find ways to incorporate them into your life in a harmonious way. "
