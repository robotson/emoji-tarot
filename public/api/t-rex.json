 "interpretation": "The T-Rex emoji represents power, dominance, and primal instincts. Just like the fierce dinosaur it depicts, this card suggests a time of great strength and assertiveness. You may find yourself in a position of authority or leadership, or feeling a surge of confidence and courage to tackle challenges head-on. However, be mindful of the potential for aggression or overbearing behavior - it's important to wield your power with responsibility and respect for others. The T-Rex card can also indicate a need to tap into your primal instincts and connect with your inner strength and intuition. Trust your gut and don't be afraid to take risks or stand up for yourself. Overall, the T-Rex card encourages you to embrace your power and use it wisely, while staying grounded and in touch with your natural instincts."
