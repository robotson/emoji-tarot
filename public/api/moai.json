 "interpretation": "The moai emoji represents a sense of stoic strength and steadfastness. Just like the statues on Easter Island, this card reminds us that even in the face of adversity, we must remain grounded and resolute in our convictions. The moai is a symbol of endurance, patience, and determination, and it encourages us to stay the course even when things get tough. This card may also indicate a need to take a more contemplative approach to a problem or situation, and to draw on our inner reserves of wisdom and experience to find a solution. Overall, the moai reminds us that we have the power to weather any storm, as long as we stay true to ourselves and remain steadfast in our beliefs."
