 "interpretation": "The \"train\" card represents movement and progress, urging you to keep moving forward towards your goals. This could be a physical journey or a metaphorical one, but either way, you are on a path towards growth and change. This card can also indicate the need for structure and routine, reminding you to stick to a plan and stay focused. However, it is important to note that this card can also symbolize the potential for a bumpy ride or unexpected detours. Be prepared to adapt and adjust as necessary, but trust that ultimately, you will reach your destination. "
