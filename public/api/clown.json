 "interpretation": "The \"clown face\" card represents the playful and entertaining aspects of life. It suggests that it's time to let loose, have fun, and not take things too seriously. However, it can also indicate a need to be cautious of someone who is not what they seem. The clown may be hiding their true intentions or emotions behind their facade. This card reminds us to trust our instincts and not be fooled by appearances."
