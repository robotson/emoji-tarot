 "interpretation": "The \"repeat button\" card represents cycles, patterns, and repetition. It suggests that you may be stuck in a loop, repeating the same mistakes or behaviors over and over again. Alternatively, it could indicate a need for repetition, such as practicing a skill or routine until it becomes second nature. This card can also represent the cyclical nature of life, with ups and downs and patterns of growth and decay. It encourages you to pay attention to the patterns in your life and break free from any negative cycles. Remember, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. It's time to break the cycle and try something new. The \"repeat button\" card reminds you that change is possible and that you have the power to break free from any negative patterns in your life."
