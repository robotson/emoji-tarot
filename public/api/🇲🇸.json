    "interpretation": "The Montserrat flag emoji depicts the British Overseas Territory of Montserrat, a small Caribbean island known for its active volcano, Soufri\u00e8re Hills. The eruption of the volcano in 1995 devastated the island, destroying the capital city of Plymouth and forcing the majority of the population to flee. Despite the challenges faced by the people of Montserrat, they have shown remarkable resilience and have rebuilt their communities in the north of the island.\n\nAs a tarot card, the Montserrat flag represents the themes of disaster and resilience. It may indicate a period of upheaval or crisis, but also suggests that the querent has the inner strength and determination to overcome these challenges. The card encourages the querent to draw on their resilience and adaptability in order to rebuild and move forward.\n\nThe Montserrat flag may also represent the importance of community and solidarity in times of crisis. The people of Montserrat have come together to support each other in the face of adversity, and this card encourages the querent to seek out and rely on the support of their own community.\n\nOverall, the Montserrat flag tarot card represents the ability to overcome adversity and rebuild in the face of disaster, drawing on inner strength and the support of others."
