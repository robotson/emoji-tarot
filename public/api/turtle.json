 "interpretation": "The turtle emoji represents a slow and steady approach to life. It suggests that the querent may need to take their time and be patient in their current situation. The turtle reminds us that the journey is just as important as the destination and that sometimes we need to slow down and enjoy the ride. This card can also indicate a need for protection and self-defense, as turtles have a hard shell to protect them from danger. It may be time to put up some boundaries and protect oneself from negative influences. The turtle is a symbol of longevity and wisdom, so this card may also suggest that the querent needs to tap into their inner wisdom and trust their intuition. The turtle encourages us to take a step back, reflect, and make deliberate choices that align with our values and goals."
