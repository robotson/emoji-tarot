 "interpretation": "The puzzle piece emoji represents the idea of fitting in and completing a bigger picture. It suggests that there may be a missing piece in your life or a situation that needs to be solved. It can also indicate the need to approach a problem or task in a methodical and strategic way, breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. This card reminds us that sometimes the solution we are seeking is right in front of us, but we need to take the time to examine and piece together the clues. The puzzle piece can also symbolize the importance of collaboration and working together to achieve a common goal. \n\nWhen the puzzle piece appears in a reading, it may indicate the need to approach a situation with a clear and focused mind, and to be open to new ideas and perspectives in order to find the missing piece of the puzzle."
