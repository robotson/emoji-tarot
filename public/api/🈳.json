This card can indicate a feeling of detachment, a need for space, or a lack of fulfillment in a situation. It may also suggest the need to let go of something or someone that is no longer serving a purpose. While the \u201cvacancy\u201d button may seem negative, it can also represent potential for new possibilities and growth. Embrace this emptiness as an opportunity for reflection and transformation."
