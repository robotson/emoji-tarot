    "interpretation": "The \"backhand index pointing down\" emoji is a symbol of rejection, disapproval, or discouragement. It is often used to convey the idea of negation, indicating a \"no\" or \"not\" response to something. As a tarot card, it can represent a situation where someone or something is being dismissed, ignored, or rejected outright.\n\nWhen this card appears in a reading, it may suggest that the querent is experiencing feelings of disappointment or discouragement. They may be facing rejection or disapproval from someone in their life, or they may be struggling with self-doubt and negative self-talk. Alternatively, this card may indicate that the querent needs to exercise caution and avoid making decisions that could lead to negative consequences.\n\nIn a more positive light, the \"backhand index pointing down\" card can also represent the need to let go of something that is no longer serving the querent. It can be a reminder to trust in the universe and have faith that things will work out in the end, even if it doesn't feel like it right now. Overall, this card encourages the querent to stay resilient in the face of adversity and not to give up on their goals and dreams."
