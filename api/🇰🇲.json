    "interpretation": "The Comoros flag represents the unity and diversity of the nation. The four stars on the flag symbolize the four main islands of the Comoros archipelago, and the crescent moon represents the Islamic faith of the majority of the population. The green color stands for the lush vegetation, while the yellow represents the sun and the blue symbolizes the sea surrounding the islands.\n\nAs a tarot card, the Comoros flag represents national pride and unity. It reminds us that despite our differences, we can come together as one people with a shared identity and purpose. This card encourages us to celebrate our diversity and find strength in our differences, rather than letting them divide us.\n\nIf you draw the Comoros flag in a tarot reading, it may indicate a need to embrace your own cultural heritage or to find common ground with others who may come from different backgrounds. It can also be a reminder to stay true to your values and beliefs, even in the face of adversity. Overall, this card is a symbol of hope and unity, encouraging us to come together for the greater good."
