    "interpretation": "The Water Buffalo emoji represents strength, power, and resilience. Just as the water buffalo can endure difficult terrain and harsh environments, this card suggests that you have the ability to persevere through challenges. It can also symbolize stubbornness or a need to stand your ground in a situation. Alternatively, the Water Buffalo may be a reminder to tap into your inner strength and rely on your own resources rather than seeking external support. This card may also indicate a need for physical activity or exercise to build strength and endurance."
