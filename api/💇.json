This can be a physical transformation, such as a new haircut or hair color, or a deeper internal transformation. It's a reminder that change is necessary for growth and that sometimes we need to let go of old patterns or beliefs to make room for something new. This card can also signify a desire for a fresh start or a need to release negative energy. "
