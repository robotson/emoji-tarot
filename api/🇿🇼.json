    "interpretation": "The Zimbabwe flag is a symbol of pride and independence, representing the country's rich history and culture. The colors of the flag are symbolic: green represents the country's agriculture and rural areas, yellow represents its mineral wealth, and red represents the bloodshed during the liberation struggle. The black stripe represents the people of Zimbabwe, and the white stripe represents peace.\n\nAs a tarot card, the Zimbabwe flag represents the importance of embracing one's history and culture, and finding pride in one's identity. It can also indicate a need for independence and self-sufficiency, as well as a desire to overcome obstacles and struggles. This card encourages us to take pride in our heritage and to embrace our individuality, even in the face of adversity. It can also serve as a reminder to stay true to ourselves and our values, and to never forget where we come from."
