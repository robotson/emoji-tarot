    "interpretation": "The \"white flag\" emoji represents surrender, peace, and the willingness to give up control or power. It can indicate a desire to end a conflict or to let go of a situation that is no longer serving you. It may also suggest the need to yield to a greater force or authority, and to accept a situation as it is rather than trying to fight against it. This card can indicate a time of transition or change, where it is important to release old patterns and beliefs in order to move forward. It may also suggest a need for forgiveness, both for oneself and for others. Overall, the \"white flag\" card invites us to let go of our ego and surrender to the flow of life, trusting that everything will work out in the end."
