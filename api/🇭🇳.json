    "interpretation": "The Honduras flag represents a country that celebrates its unity, strength, and diversity. The blue and white stripes symbolize the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, while the five blue stars in the center represent the five countries that once made up the Central American Federation. The stars also represent the unity and brotherhood of the Honduran people. \n\nIn readings, this card may represent a time of unity and strength. It could indicate the need to come together as a community or group to achieve a common goal. It could also indicate a time of diversity, where different perspectives and ideas are valued and celebrated. The Honduras flag reminds us that we are stronger together, and that our differences can make us even stronger. \n\nKeywords: Unity, Strength, Diversity."
