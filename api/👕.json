    "interpretation": "The T-Shirt card represents how we present ourselves to the world. Clothing is one of the most visible ways we express ourselves and this card asks us to consider how our wardrobe reflects our personality and values. A T-Shirt can be a statement piece, a way to show support for a cause or simply a comfortable choice. This card can also indicate a need to assert oneself or stand out from the crowd. It reminds us that our clothing choices can have an impact on how we are perceived by others. The T-Shirt card encourages us to embrace our individuality and express ourselves authentically.\n\nReversed, this card can indicate a lack of self-expression or feeling constrained by societal norms. It may be time to break out of old patterns and try something new. It can also suggest a need to pay more attention to how we present ourselves, or to avoid being too influenced by external pressures.\n\nOverall, the T-Shirt card is a reminder to be true to ourselves and to embrace the power of self-expression through our clothing choices."
