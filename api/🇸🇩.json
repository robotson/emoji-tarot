    "interpretation": "The flag of Sudan represents a country that is united in its diversity. The green color symbolizes its agricultural wealth, while the blue represents the Nile River, a life-giving force for the country. The yellow color represents the desert and the red represents the blood of those who fought for independence.\n\nThe Sudan card in the tarot represents a time of coming together, both in personal relationships and in larger communities. It is a reminder to celebrate our differences and find common ground. This card also suggests a need for independence and self-sufficiency, as Sudan fought for its own freedom.\n\nWhen this card appears in a reading, it may suggest a need to find balance between unity and independence, or to appreciate the unique qualities of those around you. It may also be a call to action to fight for your own independence and stand up for what you believe in.\n\nOverall, the Sudan card represents the power of diversity and the strength that comes from unity."
