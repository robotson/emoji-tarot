    "interpretation": "The worm emoji represents transformation and renewal. Just as worms are capable of breaking down organic matter and turning it into fertile soil, this card suggests that it is time to let go of old patterns and beliefs in order to grow and evolve. It is a reminder that even in the darkest and most difficult times, there is potential for new beginnings.\n\nIn a reading, the worm card may indicate that the querent is going through a period of deep change and that they should embrace this process rather than resist it. It may also suggest that they need to let go of old habits and beliefs that are no longer serving them in order to make room for new opportunities.\n\nOverall, the worm card represents the cyclical nature of life and the importance of embracing change in order to continue growing and evolving."
