    "interpretation": "The flag of Fiji represents the island nation's rich cultural heritage and natural beauty. The light blue background symbolizes the Pacific Ocean, while the Union Jack in the top left corner acknowledges Fiji's former status as a British colony. The shield in the center features a yellow lion holding a cocoa pod and a coconut palm, representing the country's agricultural industry. The two figures on either side of the shield are Fijian warriors, one holding a spear and the other a war club. This card suggests a connection to one's cultural roots and a respect for tradition. It also encourages a sense of pride in one's heritage and a willingness to share it with others. \n\nIn a reading, the flag of Fiji may indicate a need to reconnect with one's cultural identity or to honor the traditions of one's ancestors. It may also suggest a time of celebration or recognition of cultural achievements."
