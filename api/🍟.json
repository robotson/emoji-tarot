    "interpretation": "The French Fries card represents the indulgence and satisfaction that come from giving in to one's desires. Just as a plate of hot, crispy fries can provide comfort and pleasure, this card indicates a need to indulge oneself in order to feel satisfied. It can also represent a sense of indulgence that may be excessive or even harmful if taken too far. The French Fries card suggests that it is important to enjoy life's pleasures, but also to be aware of the consequences of one's actions.\n\nThis card can indicate a time of indulgence and pleasure in one's life, or a need to seek out comfort and satisfaction in difficult times. It may also suggest a need to let go of guilt or shame around indulgence and embrace one's desires. However, it is important to be mindful of the potential for excess and to make sure that indulgence does not become a harmful habit."
