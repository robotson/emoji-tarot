    "interpretation": "The Woman Shrugging card represents a state of confusion and uncertainty. You may find yourself at a crossroads, unsure which path to take or what decision to make. This can be a frustrating and overwhelming experience, but it is important to remember that it is okay to not have all the answers right away. Take some time to reflect on your options and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.\n\nThis card also suggests that you may be feeling a sense of helplessness or powerlessness in a situation. It is important to acknowledge your feelings and seek support from others if needed. Remember that it is okay to ask for help and that you do not have to face your challenges alone.\n\nIn a more positive light, the Woman Shrugging card can also represent a sense of acceptance and surrender. Sometimes, we simply need to let go of our need for control and trust that things will work out in the end. Have faith in yourself and the universe, and know that everything happens for a reason."
