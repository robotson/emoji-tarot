    "interpretation": "The VS button represents competition and conflict. It symbolizes the need for a winner and a loser, for a battle to be fought and for sides to be taken. This card suggests that you may be facing opposition or a challenge that requires you to take a stand and defend your position. It may also indicate that you are engaged in a competition or rivalry, whether in business or in your personal life.\n\nThe VS button reminds us that conflict is a natural part of life, and that sometimes it is necessary to fight for what we believe in. However, it also warns against becoming too focused on winning at all costs, and losing sight of what is truly important. Be mindful of your motives and actions, and make sure that you are not causing harm to others in your pursuit of victory.\n\nIn readings, the VS button may indicate a need to assert yourself and stand up for your beliefs, or it may suggest that you are facing a challenge or obstacle that requires your attention. It can also represent a competitive or confrontational relationship or situation."
