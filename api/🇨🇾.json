    "interpretation": "The Cyprus flag is a symbol of unity and division, representing the country's complex history and political struggles. The white background represents peace, while the copper-colored outline symbolizes the island's rich copper deposits. The olive branches on either side of the map represent peace and reconciliation. \n\nAs a tarot card, the Cyprus flag represents the need for unity and reconciliation in your life. It may indicate a need to bridge divides between yourself and others, or between different aspects of your own personality. This card can also signify a need to seek peace and understanding in a conflict. \n\nIf the Cyprus flag appears in a reading, consider the ways in which you can bring people together and find common ground. Look for opportunities to reconcile differences and seek peaceful solutions to problems. This card reminds us that true strength comes from unity, not division."
