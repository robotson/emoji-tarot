    "interpretation": "The blowfish card is a reminder to be cautious and protective of oneself. Just like the spines on the blowfish, we must be aware of potential threats and take measures to defend ourselves. However, it's important not to become too defensive and isolate ourselves from others. The blowfish also symbolizes the need for adaptability, as it can inflate itself to protect against predators. This card urges us to be flexible and open to change when facing challenges.\n\nIn a reading, the blowfish may indicate a need to protect oneself from harm, or a fear of vulnerability. It could also suggest the need to adapt to a new situation or be open to different perspectives. Alternatively, it could warn against becoming too guarded and missing out on opportunities for connection and growth."
