This card encourages you to embrace your independence and find creative solutions to problems. Remember that you are capable of adapting to new situations and overcoming obstacles. Trust in your abilities and have confidence in yourself. The Tristan da Cunha flag is a reminder that even in the most remote and challenging environments, there is always a way forward."
