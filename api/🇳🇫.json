    "interpretation": "The flag of Norfolk Island depicts a green triangle representing the island's lush vegetation, and a white eight-pointed star symbolizing the eight regions of the island. This emoji can represent feelings of isolation, independence, and self-sufficiency. Like the island itself, this card suggests that you are self-contained and self-reliant, and able to thrive on your own. You may feel that you don't need anyone else's help or support, and that you are capable of handling any challenge that comes your way. However, this card can also suggest that you may be too independent, and that you may need to reach out to others for help or advice. Don't be afraid to ask for assistance if you need it. The flag of Norfolk Island reminds us that even the strongest and most self-sufficient among us need support from time to time. Trust in your own abilities, but also trust in the power of community and connection."
