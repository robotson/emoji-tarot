    "interpretation": "The Micronesian flag emoji represents pride, unity, and a connection to tradition. The four stars represent the four island groups that make up Micronesia, while the blue background represents the Pacific Ocean. This card encourages you to embrace your roots, culture, and heritage. It reminds you to be proud of where you come from and to stay true to your traditions. \n\nIf you have been feeling disconnected from your culture or family, this card is a sign to reconnect and find your place in your community. It also suggests that you may be feeling homesick or longing for a sense of belonging. Take comfort in the fact that you are not alone and that there are people and places that share your background and values."
