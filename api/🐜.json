    "interpretation": "The ant emoji represents diligence, hard work, and perseverance. Just like ants tirelessly work to build their colony, this card reminds us to stay focused on our goals and keep working towards them with unwavering determination. It also suggests that sometimes, small steps and consistent efforts can lead to big results. This card can also represent teamwork and the power of working together towards a common goal. On the negative side, the ant can also indicate being too focused on work and neglecting other important areas of life. It can also suggest a need for balance and rest. Overall, the ant emoji encourages us to keep moving forward with dedication and purpose."
