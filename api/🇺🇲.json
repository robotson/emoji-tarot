    "interpretation": "The Flag of U.S. Outlying Islands is a symbol of patriotism and sovereignty. This card suggests that you are fiercely protective of your identity and heritage. You may feel a strong sense of isolation or separation from those around you, and this may be causing you to withdraw into yourself. It's important to remember that while your roots are important, it's also necessary to reach out to others and connect with them. Don't let your pride in your culture or beliefs lead to an unwillingness to listen to others or learn from them. Be open to new experiences and perspectives, and you may find that your sense of belonging expands beyond what you originally thought possible. Remember that we are all connected, and that diversity is what makes us stronger."
