    "interpretation": "The fountain emoji represents a symbol of abundance, renewal, and purification. Just like water flowing from a fountain, this card is a reminder that life is full of possibilities, and we should embrace the opportunities that come our way. The fountain also suggests the need for self-care, as it represents a source of nourishment and rejuvenation for our mind, body, and spirit. \n\nWhen this card appears in a reading, it may indicate a time of emotional healing, or a need to reconnect with our inner selves. It can also represent a period of growth and expansion, as we explore new paths and opportunities. At the same time, the fountain reminds us to stay grounded and centered, and to maintain a balance between our personal needs and our responsibilities to others."
