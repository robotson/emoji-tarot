    "interpretation": "The egg card represents potential and new beginnings. Just like an egg holds the potential for new life, this card suggests that there is untapped potential waiting to be discovered. It can symbolize a time of fertility, creativity, and growth. The egg is also a symbol of birth, suggesting that something new is about to be born in your life. However, like an egg, this potential may be hidden or not yet fully formed.\n\nThis card invites you to explore what may be hidden or not yet fully realized in your life. It can also be a reminder to trust in the process of growth and change, even if it feels uncertain or uncomfortable. If you are facing a decision or feeling stuck, the egg card can suggest that the answer may be found by tapping into your inner potential and trusting in the process of new beginnings.\n\nAssociated keywords: potential, fertility, new beginnings, birth, hidden potential, growth, creativity, trust, uncertainty."
