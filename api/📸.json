    "interpretation": "The \"camera with flash\" card is a symbol of capturing memories and moments that are worth remembering. It is a reminder to focus on the present and enjoy the beauty of life. This card can also represent the need to document experiences and to share them with others. However, it may also indicate the potential for being overly focused on appearances or the desire to present a certain image to the world. \n\nWhen this card appears in a reading, it may suggest the need to take more photos or to document important events. It may also indicate the importance of being mindful of how one presents themselves to others. Alternatively, it may suggest the need to let go of the past and to live in the present moment."
