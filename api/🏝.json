It indicates a period of time where you may find yourself alone, whether physically or emotionally. This is a time to focus on yourself and your inner thoughts, to get in touch with your intuition, and to evaluate your current situation. It also signifies the need to detach from the distractions of the outside world and connect with nature. The desert island is a reminder that sometimes we need to be alone to rediscover our true selves and recharge our energy."
