Trust your instincts and be open to new experiences. This card also signifies the need to be aware of your surroundings and be cautious of those who may be hiding their true intentions. Stay alert and trust your gut. The Lizard reminds you to be flexible and to not be afraid of change, as it may lead to new opportunities and growth."
