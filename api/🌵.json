    "interpretation": "The cactus emoji represents resilience and self-sufficiency. Just like the cactus can survive in harsh environments with minimal resources, this card reminds us to tap into our own inner strength and resourcefulness. It may also suggest a need for boundaries and protection, as the cactus has thorns for defense. In a reading, the cactus card can indicate a time of challenge or adversity, but also a time for growth and transformation."
