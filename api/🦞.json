    "interpretation": "The lobster emoji represents a creature that is strong, adaptable, and able to thrive in a variety of environments. As a tarot card, it can symbolize resilience, tenacity, and the ability to survive in the face of adversity. The lobster also has a protective shell, which can suggest a need for self-protection or boundaries. In some cases, the lobster may represent a hidden strength or resourcefulness that the querent possesses but has not yet tapped into. Overall, the lobster card encourages the querent to embrace their own inner strength and adaptability, and to trust in their ability to navigate any challenges that come their way."
