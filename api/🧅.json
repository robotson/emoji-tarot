The onion also symbolizes tears and emotional release, reminding us that sometimes we need to let go of our outer layers and allow ourselves to be vulnerable. In a reading, this card may suggest a need for introspection and self-reflection, or an invitation to explore a situation from different angles. It can also indicate the need for emotional healing or the potential for emotional breakthroughs. Associated keywords include layers, depth, vulnerability, introspection, tears, emotional release, emotional healing, and emotional breakthroughs."
