You may be called upon to stand up for yourself and assert your independence, even if it means going against the expectations of others. At the same time, this card encourages you to stay rooted in your cultural or familial traditions, drawing strength from your heritage as you navigate new experiences.\n\nOverall, the flag of Jersey reminds us to honor our past while forging our own path forward. Trust in your own strength and resilience, and take pride in the unique aspects of your identity that make you who you are."
