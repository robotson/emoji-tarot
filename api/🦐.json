    "interpretation": "The shrimp emoji represents delicacy, fragility, and vulnerability. Shrimps are small creatures that need protection and care to survive, much like our own emotions and relationships. The shrimp card reminds us to handle our emotions and relationships with care and tenderness, as they are delicate and easily hurt.\n\nWhen this card appears in a reading, it may indicate a need for greater sensitivity in our interactions with others. We may be feeling particularly vulnerable or fragile, and need to seek out support and protection. Alternatively, this card may suggest that we need to take greater care with our own emotional well-being, and pay attention to our own needs.\n\nThe shrimp emoji also represents the idea of hidden treasures - much like the pearl inside an oyster. This card may suggest that there are hidden opportunities or resources available to us, but we need to take care in uncovering them. We may need to dig deeper, or be more patient, in order to access these hidden treasures."
