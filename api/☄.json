It may signify a moment of clarity or enlightenment, a burst of inspiration, or a new opportunity that comes out of nowhere. However, this card also warns of danger or destruction, as comets can be unpredictable and destructive forces of nature. The comet encourages you to be open to new experiences and ready to adapt to unexpected circumstances, but also to be cautious and prepared for any potential risks or challenges."
