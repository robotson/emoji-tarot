    "interpretation": "The Family card represents the importance of strong bonds and relationships between loved ones. It symbolizes a sense of togetherness, unity, and support that comes from being part of a family. This card is a reminder of the love and connection that exists between family members, and encourages us to cherish and appreciate those relationships. \n\nThe four figures in the emoji represent a family consisting of two women and two boys. This may suggest a non-traditional family structure, or a family that has faced challenges and overcome them together. It may also represent a chosen family, made up of close friends or community members who have become like family."
