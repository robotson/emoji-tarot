    "interpretation": "The \"people wrestling\" card depicts a struggle for dominance or control. This can manifest in physical, emotional, or mental battles. It may represent conflict with others or with oneself. The card encourages us to confront our challenges head-on and to persevere despite difficulties. It reminds us that sometimes we need to fight for what we want and to stand up for ourselves. However, it also warns against becoming too aggressive or confrontational, and encourages finding a balance between assertiveness and cooperation."
