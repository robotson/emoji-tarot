    "interpretation": "The Mahjong Red Dragon card is a symbol of power and strength. It represents an opportunity for you to seize control of your life and make bold decisions. The red color of the dragon is a sign of good fortune and prosperity, indicating that success is within reach. This card is a reminder to trust in your abilities and take action with confidence. \n\nIn traditional Mahjong, the Red Dragon is the most valuable tile, and its appearance in this tarot deck carries the same weight. It suggests that you have the potential to achieve greatness and lead others to victory. However, be aware that this power must be wielded responsibly, as the dragon's fire can easily become destructive. Use your strength and influence for the greater good, and success will follow. "
