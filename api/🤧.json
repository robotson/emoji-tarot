    "interpretation": "The \"sneezing face\" card represents a sudden release of pent-up energy or emotions. It signifies a need to let go of something that has been causing discomfort or irritation. This could be a physical ailment or an emotional burden that has been weighing you down. The sneeze is a natural bodily function that helps us expel unwanted elements from our system, and this card encourages you to do the same with whatever is troubling you. \n\nThis card can also indicate a need for rest and self-care, as sneezing often accompanies a cold or flu. It's a reminder to slow down and take care of yourself, especially if you've been pushing yourself too hard. "
