    "interpretation": "The Left Arrow card represents a significant change in direction or a reversal of circumstances. This could indicate a change in plans, a shift in priorities, or a sudden change of heart. It may also suggest that you are being guided to take a different path in life, one that leads you away from your current situation and towards a new and exciting adventure.\n\nThis card can also suggest a need to be cautious and pay attention to warning signs. It is possible that you are headed in the wrong direction or that you may encounter obstacles along the way. Trust your instincts and be willing to change course if necessary.\n\nThe Left Arrow card encourages you to embrace change and see it as an opportunity for growth and transformation. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is to let go of the past and embrace the unknown. Trust that the universe has a plan for you and that everything will work out in the end."
