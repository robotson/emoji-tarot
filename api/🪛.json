It symbolizes the idea of taking things apart and putting them back together again, suggesting that you may need to deconstruct your current situation before you can rebuild it in a better way. This card is a reminder that sometimes, progress requires a little bit of dismantling and rearranging.\n\nThe screwdriver can also represent the idea of fixing something that is broken. This could be a physical object, but it could also be a relationship, a project, or even your own emotional state. The key is to approach the situation with a steady hand and a clear mind, focusing on the task at hand and avoiding distractions.\n\nIn a reading, the screwdriver card may indicate that you need to pay closer attention to the details of your current situation, or that you may need to take things apart and rebuild them in order to move forward. It may also suggest that you have the skills and tools you need to fix something that is broken, but you need to approach the task with care and focus."
