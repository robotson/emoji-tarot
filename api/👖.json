    "interpretation": "The Jeans card represents practicality and casual comfort. Just as jeans are a staple in many wardrobes, this card suggests that simplicity and versatility are key. It may also suggest a need for practicality and a focus on the mundane aspects of life. This card is a reminder that sometimes the simplest solution is the best one. \n\nJeans can also represent conformity or blending in with the crowd. It may be a sign to avoid standing out and to focus on fitting in with others. On the other hand, it can also suggest a lack of individuality and a need to break free from societal expectations. \n\nOverall, the Jeans card reminds us to embrace practicality and simplicity in our everyday lives. It may also be a reminder to balance blending in with standing out and staying true to ourselves."
