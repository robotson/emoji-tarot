    "interpretation": "The flag of Australia represents the country's patriotism, national identity, and independence. The blue background symbolizes the ocean surrounding Australia, while the Union Jack in the top left corner represents the country's history as a British colony. The large seven-pointed star, known as the Commonwealth Star, represents the federation of six states and the territories of the Commonwealth of Australia. The five smaller stars represent the Southern Cross constellation, which is visible in the Southern Hemisphere and is a symbol of Australia's location in the world.\n\nWhen this card appears in a reading, it may suggest a strong connection to one's country and a sense of pride in one's national identity.
