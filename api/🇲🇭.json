The Marshall Islands have a unique history and identity, having been ruled by various colonial powers before gaining independence in 1986. This card represents the spirit of independence and self-determination, as well as a connection to the ocean and the natural world. \n\nThe flag's colors of blue, white, orange, and yellow symbolize different aspects of the Marshall Islands. Blue represents the ocean, which is a vital part of the nation's culture and economy. White represents peace and clarity, which are important values in the Marshall Islands' society. Orange represents courage, and yellow represents the sunshine that is abundant in the islands.\n\nThis card encourages you to embrace your cultural identity and heritage, and to seek a deeper connection to your community and traditions. It reminds you to be courageous and independent, while also honoring the natural world and the resources that sustain us."
