    "interpretation": "The \"badminton\" card represents the need to maintain balance in your life. Just as players in a badminton game must keep the shuttlecock in motion between them, you must keep the various aspects of your life in harmony. This may involve making adjustments to your daily routine or reevaluating your priorities. Be mindful of your physical, mental, and emotional health, and strive to achieve a sense of equilibrium. Additionally, this card may indicate the need to work collaboratively with others towards a common goal. The competitive nature of badminton requires players to communicate and coordinate their movements, and you may need to do the same in your personal or professional life. Remember that teamwork can lead to success."
