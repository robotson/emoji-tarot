    "interpretation": "The Tumbler Glass emoji represents indulgence and relaxation. It suggests a time to unwind and enjoy the simple pleasures of life. This card may indicate the need for self-care, perhaps through a soothing drink or a moment of peace and quiet. It can also suggest the need to let loose and have some fun, to enjoy the company of friends and indulge in a little bit of excess. However, it is important to remember to drink responsibly and not let indulgence turn into overindulgence. "
