    "interpretation": "The \"growing heart\" emoji represents the expansion and deepening of emotions. It signifies a blossoming love or affection, indicating that something or someone has captured your heart and it's growing stronger with each passing moment. This card also suggests a time of emotional vulnerability and openness, where you are willing to take risks and put yourself out there to pursue your heart's desires. Be mindful of not becoming too attached or possessive, as this can lead to heartache. Instead, let your heart grow freely and naturally, allowing your emotions to flow without fear or inhibition. Trust in the process and let love guide you. "
