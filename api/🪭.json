Just as a fan cools you down on a hot day, this card suggests taking a break to find clarity and perspective. It's important to detach emotionally and observe from a neutral standpoint. This card can also signify the need to keep your thoughts and emotions under control, like a fan folding and unfolding with ease. Don't let your emotions overwhelm you and be mindful of your reactions. Overall, this card reminds us to stay calm, collected, and mindful in order to make the best decisions for ourselves."
