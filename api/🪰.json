You may feel agitated and unable to focus on what you want to achieve. However, it's important to remember that flies are also associated with transformation and growth. This card may be a sign that you need to examine what is bothering you and make changes to overcome it. You have the power to rise above the irritation and turn it into an opportunity for growth."
